            "abstract": "This volume comprises the thoroughly reviewed and revised papers of the First International Conference on New Trends in Applied Mathematics, ICNTAM 2022, which took place in B\u00e9ni Mellal, Morocco, 19-21 May 2022.  The papers deal with the following topics: Inverse Problems, Partial Differential Equations, Mathematical Control, Numerical Analysis and Computer Science. The main interest is in recent trends on Inverse Problems analysis and real applications in Computer Science. The latter is viewed as a dynamic branch on the interface of mathematics and related fields, that has been growing rapidly over the past several decades. However, its mathematical analysis and interpretation still not well-detailed and needs much more clarifications. The main contribution of this book is to give some sufficient mathematical content with expressive results and accurate applications. As a growing field, it is gaining a lot of attention both in media as well as in the industry world, which will attract the interest of readers from different scientist discipline",
