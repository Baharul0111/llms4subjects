            "abstract": "\"Space, to use a worn metaphor, is in the mind of the beholder. When we contemplate the seemingly limitless universe, we tend to project onto space our own hopes and dreams (as well as our fears and anxieties). But like responses to Rorschach inkblots, there are many different hopes, dreams, fears, and anxieties that one can project onto the night's sky. To those who approach it with a thirst for profits, space appears as a resource-rich goldmine, beckoning to anyone with enough wealth and privilege to take advantage of untapped markets. To those who approach it with a yearning for human expansion, space appears as a frontier that is humanity's birthright to conquer, its new manifest destiny. To those who approach it with a passion for knowledge and understanding, space appears as a tantalizing and pristine laboratory for scientific exploration. In these ways, our visions for humanity's future in space--what planets and moons we hope to visit, what we hope to accomplish when we get there--are more products of our perspectives about space (and our underlying worldviews and value systems) than anything else\"--",
