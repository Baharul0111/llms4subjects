                "The Impact of Nanoscience in the Food Industry, Volume 12 in The Handbook of Food Bioengineering series, explores how nanoscience applications in food engineering offer an alternative to satisfying current food needs that cannot be fulfilled by natural products. Nanotechnology enables the development of tailored food ingredients and structures to replace products that are difficult to obtain. The book discusses how specialized nano-preservatives, sensors and food degradation and contamination detectors were developed and how they can be introduced in food products without degrading quality or properties of the final product. A valuable resource for food engineering researchers and students alike."
