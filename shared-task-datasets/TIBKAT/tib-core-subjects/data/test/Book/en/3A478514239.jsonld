            "abstract": "This introduction to computational fluid dynamics serves as a unique advanced-undergraduate text that brings together Cebeci's lifelong experience as a teacher at the University of California and a senior scientist for Boeing Company. Conservation equations for compressible and incompressible flows are the prrime theme. The text concentrates on finite difference and finite volume methods and mostly treats two-dimensional flows, while it also keeps key arguments general enough to apply to the three-dimensional case as well. It also provides methods for solving model parabolic, elliptic and hyperbolic equations, and two chapters address boundary-layer equations. The treatment of the transition from laminar to turbulent flow makes use of the en method. Further topics are grid generation methods and extensive discussions of the Euler and the Navier-Stokes equations. The book is accompanied by CD including computer programs that have been tested in many practical applications in industrial fluid mechanics engineering. &nbsp; TOC:Introduction.- Conservation Equations.- Turbulence Models.- Numerical Methods for Model Parabolic and Elliptic Equations.- Numerical Methods for Model Hyperbolic Equations.- Inviscid Flow Equations for Incompressible Flows.- Boundary-Layer Equations.- Stability and Transition.- Grid Generation.- Inviscid Compressible Flow.- Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations.- Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations.- Appendix: Computer Programs in the CD-ROM",
