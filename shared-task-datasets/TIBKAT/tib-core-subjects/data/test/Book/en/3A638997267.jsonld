For a group of apprentice architects, artists, and designers, led by a visionary, the dire situation of their country was not an obstacle but an inspiration to plan and think ... although they were very different characters, the architects worked closely together to realize their dreams, staunchly supported by a super-creative bureaucracy and an activist state ... after 15 years of incubation, they surprised the world with a new architecture--Metabolism--that proposed a radical makeover of the entire land ... Then newspapers, magazines, and TV turned the architects into heroes: thinkers and doers, thoroughly modern men ...\"--Publisher's description",
