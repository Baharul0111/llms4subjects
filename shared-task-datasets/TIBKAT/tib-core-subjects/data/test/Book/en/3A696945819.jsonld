                "\"Today ultrasonic and electromagnetic signals are being used for characterizing materials - measuring material properties and detecting internal defects - in a variety of engineering structures, such as airplanes and space structures, civil infrastructure, nuclear power plants, pressure-vessels and pipes, as well as for inspecting human body parts, such as bones, soft tissues, tumors and unborn fetuses. In spite of the ever increasing popularity and wide range of applications of this technology by researchers in physical science and bioscience, medical technicians, factory workers and engineers, we currently have a limited supply of good books that cover both the fundamentals and the advanced applications of this technology\"--",
                "\"This textbook presents the latest advances in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and features the incorporation of electromagnetic NDE techniques, which are the second most popular NDE method after ultrasonic NDE. With questions, problems, and worked out examples, the text describes biomedical applications and presents examples of modern NDE methods in the testing of medical devices. Contributors address such topics as cylindrical waveguide applications in ultrasonic evaluation, laser-ultrasonic techniques, structural health monitoring, acoustic microscopy, THz radiation, and fiber optics\"--"
