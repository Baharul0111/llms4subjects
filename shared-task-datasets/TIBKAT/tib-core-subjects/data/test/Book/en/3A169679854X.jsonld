            "abstract": "\"Embracing a biological and evolutionary perspective to explain the human experience of place, Urban Experience and Design explores how cognitive science and biometric tools provide an evidence-based foundation for architecture and planning. Aiming to promote the creation of a healthier and happier public realm, this book describes how unconscious processing, outside our conscious awareness, directs our experience of the built environment and governs human behavior in our surroundings. This collection contains fifteen cutting-edge chapters, including contributions from researchers in the US, the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Iran. Addressing topics such as the impact of eye-tracking analysis and seeing beauty and empathy within buildings, Urban Experience and Design encourages us to reframe our understanding of design including the narrative of how modern architecture and planning came to be in the first place. This volume invites students, academics, and scholars to see how cognitive science and biometric findings give us remarkable 21st-century metrics for evaluating and improving designs, even before they are built\"--",
