                "This textbook introduces new business concepts on cloud environments such as secure, scalable anonymity and practical payment protocols for the Internet of things and Blockchain technology. The protocol uses electronic cash for payment transactions. In this new protocol, from the viewpoint of banks, consumers can improve anonymity if they are worried about disclosure of their identities in the cloud. Currently, there is not a book available that has reported the techniques covering the protocols with anonymizations and Blockchain technology. Thus this will be a useful book for universities to purchase. This textbook provides new direction for access control management and online business, with new challenges within Blockchain technology that may arise in cloud environments. One is related to the authorization granting process. For example, when a role is granted to a user, this role may conflict with other roles of the user or together with this role; the user may have or derive a high level of authority. Another is related to authorization revocation. For instance, when a role is revoked from a user, the user may still have the role. Experts will get benefits from these challenges through the developed methodology for authorization granting algorithm, and weak revocation and strong revocation algorithms.",
