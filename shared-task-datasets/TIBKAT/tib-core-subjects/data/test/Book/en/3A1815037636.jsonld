            "abstract": "\"This edited volume on combustion technology covers recent developments and provides a broad perspective of the key challenges in this emerging field. Divided into two sections, first one covers micro-combustion system, hydrogen combustor, combustion systems for gas turbine and IC engine, coal combustor for power plant and gasifier system. Second section focusses on combustion system pertaining to aerospace including supersonic combustor, rocket engine and gel propellant combustion. Issues related to energy producing devices in power generation, process industries and aerospace vehicles and efficient and eco-friendly combustion technologies are also explained. Features: Provides comprehensive coverage of recent advances in combustion technology. Explains definite concepts about the design and development in combustion systems. Captures developments relevant for aerospace area including gel propellant, aluminium based propellants, gasification, and gas turbine. Aims to introduce the combustion system in different industries. Expounds novel combustion systems with reference to pertinent renewable technologies This book aims at Researchers and Graduate students in Chemical, Mechanical and Aerospace engineering, and Energy and environmental engineering, thermal engineering. This book also aims at Practicing engineers and decision makers in industry and research labs, Petroleum Utilization\"--",
