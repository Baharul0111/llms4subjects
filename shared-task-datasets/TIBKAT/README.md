# üìö The **LLMs4Subjects** TIBKAT Shared Task Dataset

## üîç About

The TIB subject matter experts index the TIB's technical records based on the GND subjects taxonomy. Very early on in the conception of TIB record annotation guidelines, certain subject classes of the GND subjects were identified as the TIB's core subject classes. Technical science in a sense has advanced leaps and bounds since then which is why the TIB's records are now annotated with GND subjects that are not classified against those early identified TIB core subject classes. Nevertheless, since the TIBKAT dataset compiled for the shared task contains over 100,000 records, we want to offer the participants of the shared task the choice of using a relatively smaller compilation instead where the records included are only those annotated with at least one of the GND subjects in the TIB's core subject classification scheme.

## üìÇ Repositories Included

- [**all-subjects**](https://github.com/jd-coderepos/llms4subjects/tree/main/shared-task-datasets/TIBKAT/all-subjects) **dataset:** The training dataset split contains 85,489 records and the development dataset split contains 14,245 records. This dataset is a superset of the dataset linked below. For this collection, no restrictions 

- [**tib-core-subjects**](https://github.com/jd-coderepos/llms4subjects/tree/main/shared-task-datasets/TIBKAT/tib-core-subjects) **dataset:** The training dataset split contains 41,902 records and the development dataset split contains 6,980 records. In this subset collection, records were included only if at least one of the annotated GND subjects belonged to the original TIB's core subject classification.

Between the two datasets, participants are free to make their choice, maybe based on dataset size or to focus attention on a smaller more manageable subset of the GND collection for subject indexing, i.e. by looking only at the GND subjects within the TIB's core subject classes, of the dataset to download to align their LLM subject tagging solutions.

Each dataset folder is organized similarly with a `data` directory containing the actual files and a `data-statistics` directory containing a detailed look at various numbers on various aspects of the dataset.


## üßê How to interpret a Formatted Record in the TIBKAT shared task dataset

This guide provides an overview of how to interpret a TIBKAT record, with a particular focus on understanding the `dcterms:subject` property. This property is part of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, a standard used for describing the content and metadata of web resources.

### Understanding TIBKAT Records
TIBKAT records contain metadata about various resources, such as books, journals, and digital files, cataloged by the German National Library of Science and Technology, i.e. the TIB. These records are structured in a way that includes multiple properties, each describing a different aspect of the resource.

#### [The `dcterms:subject` Property](#how-to-subjects)
The `dcterms` subject property (often represented as `<dc:subject>` in XML or similar syntax) is used to describe the subject or topics covered by the resource. This can include keywords, phrases, or classification codes that reflect the content of the resource. The TIBKAT records subject annotations were made by a dedicated team of 17 expert subject specialists responsible for 28 different subjects, viz. Architecture, Civil Engineering, Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Energy Technology, Educational Science, Earth Sciences, History, Information Technology, Literary Studies and Linguistics, Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics, Medical Technology, Plant Sciences, Philosophy, Physics, Law, Study of Religions, Social Sciences, Sports Sciences, Theology, Environmental Engineering, Traffic Engineering, Materials Science, and Economics.

##### How to read the `dcterms:subject` property

1. **Access the TIBKAT Record:** Begin by accessing the released JSON-LD TIBKAT records in the dataset or supplementary dataset folders.

2. **Locate the `dcterms:subject` Property:** Within the record, look for the `dcterms:subject` property. This property can have one or more subject headings. Each subject heading is obtained from the GND Sachbegriff (subject headings) taxonomy. More information on the GND as it pertains to TIBKAT can be found [here](https://github.com/jd-coderepos/llms4subjects/tree/main/gnd-how-to). 

3. **Interpret the Subject Entries:** Each entry under the `dcterms:subject` property represents a subject or topic that the resource relates to. These entries are available as:
   - **Classification Codes:** Standardized GND subject heading codes can be found as values.

4. **Use the Subjects for Research:** Within libaray systems, the subjects codes listed under the `dcterms:subject` property when mapped to their labels can be valuable for understanding the focus of the resource, conducting research, or finding related materials in the catalog.

### Conclusion

Understanding the `dcterms:subject` property within TIBKAT records is crucial for researchers, librarians, and anyone looking to categorize or find resources based on their subject matter. By focusing on this property, users can gain insights into the content and relevance of resources cataloged in the TIBKAT system.
