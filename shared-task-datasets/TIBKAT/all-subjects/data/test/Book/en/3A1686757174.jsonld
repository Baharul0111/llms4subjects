            "title": "On commemoration : global reflections upon remembering war",
            "abstract": "\"War has been commemorated since ancient times. The recent First World War centenaries are proof that remembering conflict continues to produce strong feelings among people of all walks of life. But how, in the twenty-first century, can we do commemoration better? In particular, how can commemoration contribute to post-war reconciliation and reconstruction? In this book, a global roster of distinguished individuals - poets, an international human rights advocate, musicians, policy-makers, novelists, academics, a sculptor, a world-renowned architect, members of different faiths, composers, a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist and military veterans - debate these questions and ponder the future of commemoration. The book focuses on three modes of commemoration: Textual Commemoration - commemoration in writing and images; Monumental Commemoration - monuments, architecture, museums, sculptures, battlefields and sites of mourning; Aural Commemoration - music, sound and silence. Polemics and reflections together with poetry and creative prose movingly illuminate a subject that is sensitive and sobering but which also speaks to our common humanity\"--",
