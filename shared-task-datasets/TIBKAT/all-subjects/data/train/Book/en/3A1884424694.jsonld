                "\"This book does not follow the traditional biographical model of providing a detailed linear narrative of the life of D. H. Lawrence from birth to death. There are many scholarly and popular biographies of the author that offer more or less comprehensive accounts of his life; readers can find these listed in the Bibliography.1 I address here some of the ways in which Lawrence's life can illuminate his writing (and vice versa). The book is organised chronologically, focusing on nine important subjects in the author's life and writing. Chapters 1-3 cover Lawrence's early life up to his completion of the first version of Women in Love in November 1916, while Chapters 6-9 deal with his writings from the spring of 1917 to the end of his life; Chapters 4 and 5 offer a reflective interlude, considering subjects which became particularly pressing for Lawrence during the war years, but which occupy a central position across his career, namely his treatment of taboo topics, his conflicted relationship to the literary marketplace and the censorship of his work, and his attitudes to sex, sexuality and sexual identity. In each chapter, details from the biographical record are drawn upon to provide interpretive contexts for the close analyses of texts. The coverage of texts is necessarily selective, but I have tried to offer fresh readings of Lawrence's work in different genres. Although seven of the nine chapters are strictly chronological, the issues addressed are clearly relevant to more than one period in the author's life, and I hope readers will be stimulated to extend my approach and find resonances of their own as they read (or re-read) Lawrence's writing\"--"
