                "\"The Letters of Ernest Hemingway documents the life and creative development of a gifted artist and outsized personality whose work would both reflect and transform his times. Volume 2 (1923-1925) illuminates Hemingway's literary apprenticeship in the legendary milieu of expatriate Paris in the 1920s. We witness the development of his friendships with the likes of Sylvia Beach, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and John Dos Passos. Striving to 'make it new', he emerges from the tutelage of Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein to forge a new style, gaining recognition as one of the most formidable talents of his generation. In this period, Hemingway publishes his first three books, including In Our Time (1925), and discovers a lifelong passion for Spain and the bullfight, quickly transforming his experiences into fiction as The Sun Also Rises (1926). The volume features many previously unpublished letters and a humorous sketch that was rejected by Vanity Fair\"--",
                "\"Hemingway described his artistic method as inventing from experience. In his letters we live in the country, meet the people, track the relationships, and witness events unfold that later he would forge into fiction. In a postscript to the 11 September 1925 letter to his mother telling of his novel in progress, Hemingway added a note about his wife: Hadley is better looking and huskier than ever. She's had her hair cut like a boys as all the chic people now and has several people in love with her including a very nice bull fighter named Nino de la Palma who dedicates bulls to her and gives her the ears. These are carefully saved in my handkerchiefs\"--"
