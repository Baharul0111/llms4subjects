                "Inflammation is an adaptive response that is triggered by noxious stimuli and conditions, such as infection and tissue injury. Neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, tissue macrophages and dendritic cells can all ingest bacteria, tissues debris and apoptotic cells after injury or infection. These cells derived from bone marrow progenitors, circulate in the blood and migrate to peripheral tissues. Macrophages produce and secrete a cascade of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and IL-12 that are trafficked and secreted by constitutive exocytosis. IL-10 and IL-6 are known to be rapidly induced during infection and / or injury, which make them possible mediators of early phagocyte recruitment. This thesis work aimed at detailed investigation of role of these cytokines in peritoneal inflammation. Under normal physiological conditions peritoneal cavity of normal BALB/c mice contains mainly CD45+ lymphocytes and CD11b+ myeloid cells with typical macrophage phenotype. The resident peritoneal cells play an important role in organismal homeostasis by taking part in innate and adaptive immunity. To explore this in detail, the physiological properties of peritoneal resident macrophage populations were studied under steady state and during inflammation conditions. Upon rapid induction of sterile inflammation by thioglycollate or lipopolysaccharide, the resident peritoneal cells could no longer be recovered in a peritoneal wash 6h after ...",
