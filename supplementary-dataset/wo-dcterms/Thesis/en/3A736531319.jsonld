                "The application of enzymes is described in many fields of chemical and pharmaceutical industry. Enzymes enable synthesis routes which are often less environmentally harmfull than established chemical routes. Especially their stereo-, regio- and chemoselective reactions provide in many cases access to pharmaceutically relevant products and intermediates. Still, for some enzyme classes there is nevertheless need for new or improved enzymes. In particular for oxidative enzymes, the currently available enzymes often do not meet the desires. The discovery of novel biocatalysts, which enable the transformation of chemically to enzymatically catalysed processes, was the main motivation of this thesis. One traditional way to gain access to novel enzymes is the enrichment cultivation of an environmental sample and subsequent isolation of organisms with the desired enzymatic activities. An alternative is the screening of already existing strain collections. Still, most microorganisms cannot be cultivated in the laboratory. The metagenomic approach provides access to these organisms and their biocatalysts by circumvention of the cultivation step and direct isolation of the DNA of an environmental sample. This metagenomic DNA can be screened for the presence of enzymes either in an activity-based or a sequence-based way. In this thesis, the activity-based approach was chosen because in this way completely new enzymes can be found which are not homologous to already described enzymes."
