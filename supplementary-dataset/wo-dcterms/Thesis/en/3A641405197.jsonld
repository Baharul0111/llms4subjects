                "Hantaviruses are emerging viruses with a world-wide distribution. They are transmitted by rodents and depending on the virus species they can cause severe diseases with a fatality rate of up to 50 % in humans. During the years 2004/2005, 2007 and also in this year a drastically increased number of human Hantavirus infections were observed in several European countries including Germany. The areas most affected in Germany were Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Lower Saxony and Northrhine-Westfalia. People who, because of their profession, came into close contact to the rodent host and therefore in contact with the virus are considered the risk groups for Hantavirus infections. The detection of human infections are mainly based on the detection of Hantavirus specific antibodies by using serological assays such as ELISA and Western blot tests. For a highly sensitive and specific detection of human Hantavirus infections in Germany, novel serological assays for the European Hantaviruses Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV), Puumalavirus (PUUV) and Tulavirus (TULV) were established and validated. In addition, protocols for the performance of these novel assays and their usage in seroepidemiological studies were defined. Based on these protocols these novel assays were used for the study of Hantavirus prevalence in different groups of the population and in in different areas of Germany..."
