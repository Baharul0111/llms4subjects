                "One of the aims of this work was to generate a non restrained force field model including carbon contamination to make the adsorption simulations more realistic and comparable with experimental data. Another purpose was to find out how the special recognition of small linker proteins on titanium dioxide is working. During this work a fixed and a non restrained rutile (100) model was used and critical properties were observed which are not only related to the surface. The rigid water layers on top of the oxide are very important for the protein and peptide adsorption. Therefore the first discussing object were the properties of the water layers and how they can be influenced. The charge distribution on the surface was found to have a big effect on them. Depending on the charges of the surface atoms or the functional groups, resulting out of the hydroxylation equilibrium, precisely the first water layer gets more rigid or smother. This has a big effect on biomolecule adsorption. The peptides need to penetrate these water layers to generate direct interaction points. The correct description of the surface in molecular dynamic simulations therefore has a high influence on the results. The better the model is the better the findings are comparable with experimental ones. Additionally carbon contamination was mimicked by using a monolayer of pentanol molecules. This fits very good with experimental data (e.g. contact angle) and make the oxide model more hydrophobic. Interaction of ..."
