This book includes: A range of worksheets, with activities to help families recognise difficulties, discover solutions and celebrate success. Games focused on encouraging families to recognise their individual and family strengths. Guidance for professionals as they use the resource. Fully photocopiable and beautifully illustrated, this is vital resource for social workers, counsellors, mental health professionals and individual and family psychotherapists working with families and children\"--",
