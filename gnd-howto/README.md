(_note: The MARC format was developed by Henriette Avram at the Library of Congress during the 1960s. Avram's work was instrumental in creating a standardized format for the representation and exchange of bibliographic data in machine-readable form, paving the way for modern library cataloging systems. The MARC (Machine-Readable Cataloging) format is a standard for the representation and communication of bibliographic and related information in machine-readable form. It's used by libraries and related organizations to catalog and exchange information about books, journals, and other materials. The format structures data in records, with each record divided into fields that contain specific pieces of bibliographic information_)
