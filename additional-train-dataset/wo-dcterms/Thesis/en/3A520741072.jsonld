                "The non-natural substances in commonly used UV protection creams such as TiO2, are known to have a photocatalytic side effect, which is very harmful to human skin. This study presents some properties of clays and clays minerals concerning UV protection potential, which can be very helpful for the development of new UV protection cream generation. Clays and clay minerals are demonstrated that they have potential to absorb UV-radiation. The structures of clay particles in cream were shown to be dependent on the layer charge of clay minerals. The total amount of Fe2C&gt;3 in chemical composition of clay plays a key role in determining the UV-absorption ability of the clay matter. Moreover, the UV-absorption ability also depends on the expandable or non- expandable property of the clay. The studies were also performed on the mixtures of wool-wax-alcohol cream and nanosuspension obtained by the extraction of fungi mass Ganoderma pfeifferi by using plantacare together with clay. The combination of clays and nanosuspension increased its UV-absorption ability. The skin model test was performed in vivo in mouse ears with skin flora Escherichia coli and infectious bacteria Staphylococcus aureus in order to determine the effects of cream samples on skin under UV irradiation and skin infection. From the results of characterization of clays and clay minerals properties in UV protection cream, this study also brings some ideas about products designing."
