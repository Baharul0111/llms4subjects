                "The hairpin ribozyme-based system CRZ-2 was used to investigate the self-processing products derived from ribozyme reaction. Inter- as well as intramolecular ribozyme reactions were performed with CRZ-2 and its linear 83mer (l-83mer), whereas oligomers and circularized RNAs were identified. Complete transition through the CRZ-2&apos;s cleavage cascade was shown by the identification of intermediate and final cleavage products inter alia via Sanger sequencing of the corresponding complementary DNAs of the 83mer and the 92mer. Additionally, comparative polyacrylamide electrophoresis of test systems allowed to assign unambiguously the cleavage products of all systems in denatured gels. To distinguish between linear and circular products of ribozyme reactions several methods were combined: i) 2D-PAGE ii) assessment of exonucleolytic decay of RNA in solution and in gels, iii) comparison of the migration manner of an inactive RNA monomer with the reaction mixture of the l-83mer after ligation reaction iv) AFM and v) Ferguson-Plot. It became apparent that linear products such as oligomers up to trimers are exclusively derived from CRZ-2&apos;s ribozyme reaction, while the l-83mer also forms RNA rings (the cyclic 83mer). The analyses of the reaction products of CRZ-2 and the l-83mer enabled their usage as reference systems for the investigation of hairpin ribozyme variants. The bioinformatic development of new CRZ-2 variants was performed in collaboration with the group of prof. Ivo Hofacker ...",
