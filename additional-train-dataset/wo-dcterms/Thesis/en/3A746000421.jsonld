                "In the GDR, official topographic ordnance survey maps were continuously updated and adapted. This dissertation documents and analyses the stages of this process. After 1945, the traditional production of ordnance survey maps could not be continued. Instead, under the guidance of a central authority a new and distinct cartography was developed. In the post-war years, the immediate need for maps was first met with reproductions of outdated German ordnance survey maps. Between 1954 and 1970 the GDR introduced a new and uniform system of ordnance survey maps which was based on standards agreed on by the member states of the Warsaw Pact. The scales were 1:10 000 and 1:1 000 000. These maps were based on new topographic mapping (scale: 1:10 000) and covered the whole territory. Between 1971 - 1990, these maps were updated and improved every 5 years. Due to tightened security regulations during the Cold War, from 1966 on new maps for the national economy had to be produced which were derived from the official ones. The scales were 1:10 000 and 1:1 500 000. On the one hand, this dissertation focuses on the characteristics of both types of maps. On the other hand, it is an in-depth analysis of the technological and editorial conditions under which these maps were produced, improved and updated. Between 1990 - 2000, the ordnance survey maps were adjusted to their counterparts of the FRG which resulted in a system of new and uniform ordnance survey maps ...",
