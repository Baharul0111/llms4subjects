                "RNA engineering is a research area that deals among others with the development of novel ribozymes or the equipping of known ribozymes with new or improved properties. Next to the design of new ribozymes by in vitro selection or rational design the engineering process includes also the validation of the developed systems by means of activity tests or structural studies. Based on the methods of RNA engineering the aim of this work was to design hairpin ribozyme variants that allow site-directed RNA sequence alterations within suitable RNA substrates. A potential therapeutical application of these ribozymes as well as their role in a possible RNA world was a major focus of this doctoral thesis. In this work a reporter system enabling the detection of a twin ribozyme-mediated repair reaction within cells has been successfully developed. The reporter system is based on the repair of a four base deletion within the EGFP mRNA. A twin ribozyme developed by rational design was able to catalyze the repair reaction gaining a repair product yield of 32 %. The successfully developed reporter system can now be used for experiments under cell culture conditions allowing both adaption and optimization of twin ribozyme-mediated RNA repair in cells to pave the way for a general intracellular application of this twin ribozyme strategy for the repair of desired target RNAs. Additionally, another ribozyme capable of catalyzing RNA sequence exchange has been developed that could have played an ..."
