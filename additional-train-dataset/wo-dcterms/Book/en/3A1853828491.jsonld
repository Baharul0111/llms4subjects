                "This book brings the recent collection of smart technologies. Smart cities challenges and key requirements are discussed through the technological solutions, IoT, cloud computing, block chain and artificial intelligence.   Firstly, the key technologies contributing to the smart cities research are identified. Then, the most popular ones are covered in context to their theoretical and practical applications.  Smart cities technologies are one of the recent research areas. Every day new technological solutions are coming to make smart cities more sustainable. The book explores the integration of main key technologies for smart cities which are IoT &amp; cloud computing, data science, AI and block chain &amp; Industry 4.0. Moreover, some integrated solutions using AI, data science and IoT will attract the attention of end users.  Primary market of the book is aimed toward the undergraduate and master students. IoT, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and block chain are elective courses at the bachelor level in the engineering domain, and its application areas in context to smart cities are covered in this book.  The book is a good source of reference for their master dissertations. Ph.D. students or scholars who are working on these key technologies like IoT &amp; cloud, AI, data science, block chain &amp; Industry 4.0 will find this book as a constant source of reference for their ongoing research.  Smart city planners, architects and municipal experts may also find this book useful."
