                "This follow-up volume to MMOs from the Inside Out is a further collection of bold ideas, information, and instruction from one of the true pioneers of Massively-Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games. Whereas its predecessor looked at how MMOs can change the world, MMOs from the Outside In: How Psychology, Law, Culture and Real Life see Massively-Multiplayer Role-playing Games looks at how the world can change MMOs – and not always for the better. The aim of this book is to inform an up-coming generation of designers, to alert and educate players and designers-to-be, and to caution those already working in the field who might be growing complacent about society’s acceptance of their chosen career. Playing and creating MMOs does not happen in a bubble. MMOs are so packed with potential that those who don’t understand them can be afraid, and those who do understand them can neglect their wider impact. Today&apos;s examples are little more than small, pioneering colonies on the shore of a vast, uncharted continent. What monsters lurk beyond the horizon? What horrors will explorers bring back to torment us? MMOs from the Outside In is for people with a spark of curiosity: it pours gasoline on that spark. It: • Explains how MMOs are perceived, how they could – and perhaps should – be perceived, and how the can contribute to wider society. • Delves into what researchers think about why players play. • Encourages, enthuses, enrages, engages, enlightens, envisions, and enchants. • Doesn&apos;t tell you what to think, it tells you to think. What You Will Learn: • The myriad challenges facing MMOs – and to decide for yourself how to address these challenges. • What MMOs bring to the world that it didn’t have before. • How MMOs are regarded, and what this means for how they will be regarded in future. • That playing and designing MMOs has implications for those who don’t play or design them. Whom This Book is For: MMOs from the Outside In is a book for those who wish to know more about the wider influence of game design in general and MMO design in particular. It&apos;s for people who play MMOs, for people who design MMOs, and for people who study MMOs. It&apos;s for people with a yearning to see beyond the worlds of their imagination and to change the world around them."
