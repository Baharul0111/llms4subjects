            "abstract": "\"The oil and gas industry is a complex sector with significant reach in terms of providing the energy needs of the global economy and the security, environmental and development consequences thereof. In particular, the sector is extremely important for the economic growth of emerging markets and developing countries. Furthermore, the life span of oil and gas resources is finite, with high health and safety risks and substantial environmental costs that require careful management and sustainability practices to ensure optimal extraction and utilisation of these resources. This book examines the challenges and opportunities in the oil and gas industry, in the context of emerging markets and developing economies. It provides comprehensive coverage of the management and sustainability practices of the sector, the environmental impact and sustainability of resources as well as the businesses that operate in the sector across the entire value chain. It addresses the current discourse on topics such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the Green Economy, the Paris Agreement and Glasgow Climate Pact and concludes with a chapter on the future of the oil and gas industry. The discussions around energy and energy transitions in particular continue to gain momentum and the book provides a wide-reaching and up-to-date overview of the industry. The book introduces readers to the concepts and formal models of analysis in the oil and gas sector and will serve as a useful resource for students, scholars and researchers in operations, marketing, procurement and supply chain management, project management, health and safety management, environmental economics, natural resource economics, development finance, and development studies. Researchers and practitioners working in these areas will also find the book a useful reference material\"--",
