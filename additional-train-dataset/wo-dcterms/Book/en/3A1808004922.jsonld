                "\"In this handbook, sixty authors, senior and junior educators and researchers from six continents, provide an overview of two hundred years of landscape architectural education. They tell the stories of schools and people, of visions, and of experiments that constitute landscape architecture education heritage. Through taking an international perspective, the handbook centers inclusivity with an appreciation for how education develops in different political and societal contexts. Part one introduces the field of education history research, including research approaches and international research exchange. Spanning more than one hundred years, part two and three investigate and compare early and recent histories of landscape architecture education in different countries and schools. In part four, the book offers new perspectives for landscape architecture education. Education research presents a substantial opportunity for challenging studies to increase the pedagogic and didactic, the academic and historic, and the disciplinary knowledge basis. Through a boundary-crossing approach, these studies about landscape architecture education provide a reference to teachers and students, policy makers and administrators, who strive for innovative, holistic and interdisciplinary practice\""
