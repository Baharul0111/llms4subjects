Stern articulates the ideas that govern his design process through this rich visual presentation of all types of his work: museums and cultural institutions, colleges and universities, commercial and residential developers, and, famously, private residential clients throughout the United States and Europe. Evidence serves as a visual synthesis of Stern's methodologies, revealing the firm's vision through juxtapositions of building, material and landscape: \"We never think of just the building. We like to think of the next bigger thing--what other buildings will come next to it, but also the siting and landscaping. Abstract compositional principles do interest me but not when I begin a design. I begin with a cultural assessment of the building as a type, the place it is set in, and lastly its obligations to its particular moment in time",
