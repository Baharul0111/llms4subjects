                "Precision Agriculture presents the latest scientific results from worldwide research, field studies and practical application. The book contains peer-reviewed papers that were presented at the 4th European Conference on Precision Agriculture.The papers focus on precision agriculture research containing interdisciplinary site analysis, integrative measures and management strategies as well as on practical applications. The economic and environmental effects of implementing the precision agriculture concept are featured in many of them.The unique feature of the fourth conference was that it was held in parallel with the 1st European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming - the links between both technologies were drawn and the possible interactions between them were shown for the first time. The potential is to integrate both technologies to encompass the whole farm. Peer-reviewed papers from the Precision Livestock conference are presented in a companion proceedings, Precision Livestock Farming"
