                "The essays in this volume - written by twenty international scholars - are dedicated to Professor Brian Bosworth who has, in over forty-five years, produced arguably the most influential corpus of historical and historiographical research by one scholar. Professor Bosworth&apos;s name is often synonymous with scholarship on Alexander the Great, but his expertise also spreads far wider, as the scope of these essays demonstrates. The collection&apos;s coverage ranges from Egyptian and Homeric parallels, through Roman historiography, to Byzantine coinage. However, the life of Alexander provides the volume&apos;s central theme, and among the topics explored are the conqueror&apos;s resonance with mythological figures such as Achilles and Heracles, his divine pretensions and military display, and his motives for arresting his expedition at the River Hyphasis in India. Some of Alexander&apos;s political acts are also scrutinized, as are the identities of those supposedly present in the last symposium where, according to some sources, the fatal poison was administered to the king. Part of the collection focuses on Alexander&apos;s legacy, with seven essays examining the Successors, especially Craterus, and Ptolemy, and Alexander&apos;s ill-fated surviving dynasty, including Olympias, Eurydice, and Philip III Arrhidaeus. --Provided by publisher",
