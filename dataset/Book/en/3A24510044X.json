            "abstract": "The present book on the life and work of Joze Plecnik (1872-1957) represents a timely novelty. It is only recently that Plecnik has gained recognition as the most important Slovene and Yugoslav artist, and that his name has become fully integrated into our cultural awareness. His rise to world prominence was finally consolidated in 1986 with the great retrospective exhibition of his work at the Pompidou Center in Paris. In the past decade, Plecnik has emerged not only as a member of Moderna, the Slovene artistic movement that encompassed the period from the end of the 19th-century to World War I, but also as a powerful representative of 20th-century Modernism. He has escaped any theoretical categorization, since he did not embrace any individual dogma or subscribe to any specific modernist doctrine. Incorporating both historical and modern elements, his work offered a necessary stepping stone between 19th-century eclecticism and contemporary functionalism. This is the first truly comprehensive monograph on Plecnik&apos;s work, based on more than fifteen years of research by author Peter Krecic. Following a chronological organization, the author explores Plecnik&apos;s life from his education and architectural training to his professional development and mature production. Mr. Krecic examines in detail the architect&apos;s fundamental works, as well as his methodology and design process. With over 300 illustrations, including splendid photographic documentation and many facsimiles of original drawings from Plecnik&apos;s archives, this book is incomparable in beauty and quality.",
