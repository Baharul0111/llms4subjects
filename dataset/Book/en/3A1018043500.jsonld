                "Phytoremediation is one of the cost effective procedures for cleaning or removing pollutants from soil or water matrices. Over the last few decades, thousands of publications about different aspects of phytoremediation were created. This massive amount of data requires systematization, classification and ordering. On the other hand, many aspects of phytoremediation are not elaborated properly. This current book contains classical and specific literature reviews, new approaches in phytoremediation techniques and new areas for the realization of phytoremediation, which is not related with traditional pollutants as heavy metals. The first chapter is a classical review about using high biomass non-hyperaccumulator plant species for remediation of the toxic metal polluted soils. This chapter provides a lot of information to help readers better understand physiological, biochemical, and molecular aspects of such regular plant species used to increase phytoremediation efficiency. The second chapter (\"Arsenic, the Silent Threat: New Phytoremediation Strategies for Contaminated Soils and Waters\") provides information about one of the most dangerous toxic metalloids, which is known as arsenic. This chapter aims to describe the current state of research and advances of knowledge concerning the phytoremediation of arsenic-polluted areas, focusing on mechanisms of As response in plants and the different strategies to cope with the metalloid, tolerance mechanisms that can be used to modify arsenic uptake, transport or detoxification in order to improve phytoremediation efficiency. The selection of the right and most effective plant for phytoremediation is one of the most important parts of this book--"
