                "This book provides the nuts-and-bolts information to transform the way your organization designs, manages, and distributes enterprise data to consumers. Data has always been considered as an essential part of the IT infrastructure across most organizations in supporting their business operations. However, a complete paradigm shift has occurred in recent years as data is increasingly recognized as an asset that could be commercially sold as a service, in and of itself. Based on the author’s first-hand experience and expertise, this book offers a proven framework for sharing core enterprise data using reusable data services. The book will cover how organizations can generate business revenues by providing data as a service to their clients for fee-based subscriptions. The book goes on to explain, in detail, how to acquire and distribute data across heterogeneous platforms effectively using enterprise SOA principles, industry data standards and leveraging new technologies such as data virtualization, cloud, and Big Data stream computing. . Presents a comprehensive approach for introducing data as a service in any organization for the first time . Recommended best practices and industry standards for sharing master, reference, and big data with data consumers . Commercialization aspects of data as a service and its potential for generating revenues. Covers real world applications of DaaS such as ‘Big Data as a Service’. Real-life case studies on various innovative architecture blueprints and related patterns Topics covered in this book are wide-ranging starting with the presentation of the need for providing data as a service and the technical challenges involved in making that transformation.
