            "abstract": [
                "The book is an outgrowth of a number of courses, at various levels of sophistication, delivered by the author in the years 2008–2014. It is built around the conceptual framework of two probabilistic models with deep physical connotations: Schramm-Loewner evolutions and the Dyson’ interacting Brownian motion model (coined within the random matrix theory). The author’s idea (originating from a number of his own publications) is to pursue a systematic theroretical thread that begins from the standard Brownian motion, then splits into a derived family of D-dimensional Bessel processes with D≥1 (links with the absorbing, D=3, and reflecting, D=1, Brownian motions are mentioned). Critical D-values are discussed. Bessel processes in turn are associated with the next-level derived theories: that of Schramm-Loewner evolutions and the Dyson model of the eigenvalue process in random matrix theory, Albeit unrelated per se, those models are shown to inherit some of the properties of the Bessel processes, specifically their critical (with respect to D≥1) behaviors. The Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) is analyzed as a complexification of the Bessel flow. The D-dependence of the Bessel flow is mapped onto the three phases, exhibited by the SLE paths. For the SLE(D), Cardy’s formula is derived, and links (some of them in the form of conjectures) with various statistical mechanics and fractal physics models are described. For specific values of D, SLE(D) paths can be interpreted as scaling limits of, e.g., random spanning trees, critical percolation, critical Ising interface, loop-erased random walks. Half of the book is devoted to the celebrated Dyson’s RMT model, which is interpreted as the multivariate extension of the BES(3). The notion of determinantal martingale representation (DMR) is introduced in relation with noncolliding processes. That enables an extension of the Dyson model to an infinite number of particles (noncolliding processes), both at equilibrium and out of equilibrium. Under suitable conditions, nonequilibrium sine and Airy processes are introduced and their relaxation properties are established. The Tracy-Widom distribution is derived for the Dyson model. The book is composed of three chapters (Bessel processes, Schramm-Loewner evolution and Dyson model). Each one is preceeded by an abstract, and concluded by excercises and a list of references.",
