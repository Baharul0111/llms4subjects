            "abstract": "A comprehensive and intimate study of the high modernist Patrick Gwynne, his architecture and interiors. In 1938, the young Patrick Gwynne burst upon the architectural scene with The Homewood, Surrey, the early modern movement country house now open to the public by the National Trust. Gwynne lived in the house until his death in 2003, over the years enriching it with contemporary features and furniture of his own design, and creating the beautiful woodland garden. Gwynne&apos;s small and very personal architectural practice focussed mainly on sophisticated shops, restaurants and innovative private houses. All his clients, which included famous film stars, were excited by the new modernism and in Gwynne they found a progressive architect with stylish and innovative designs solutions that made for distinctive buildings and interiors. In a career spanning sixty years, Gwynne&apos;s designs brilliantly reflected the major architectural styles. In the 1930s, The Homewood and his interiors for \"bachelor friends\" made him a leading proponent of the new modernism; his mid-century modern works of the post-war period sparkled with glamour and fascinating geometric plans, like the octagonally-shaped Dell Restaurant in London?s Hyde Park; and to the concrete and glass of Brutalism, Gwynne bestowed a welcoming elegance as with his extension to the Theatre Royal, York.0Neil Bingham draws on his extensive interviews and correspondence with the architect and clients. The book is richly illustrated with historic photographs by famous architectural photographers of the period, newly commissioned images as well as drawings of Gwynne?s ingenious plans",
