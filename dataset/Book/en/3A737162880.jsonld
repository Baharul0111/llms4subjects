            "abstract": "\"Revered biographer Ray Monk solves the enigma of Robert Oppenheimer&apos;s  life and personality and brilliantly illuminates his contribution to  the revolution in twentieth-century physics.  In Robert Oppenheimer,  Ray Monk delves into the rich and complex intellectual life of  America&apos;s most fascinating and elusive scientist, the father of the  atomic bomb. As a young professor at Berkeley, the wealthy, cultured  Oppenheimer finally came into his own as a physicist and also began a  period of support for Communist activities. At the high point of his  life, he was chosen to lead the Manhattan Project and develop the  deadliest weapon on earth: the atomic bomb. Upon its creation,  Oppenheimer feared he had brought mankind to the precipice of  self-annihilation and refused to help create the far more powerful  hydrogen bomb, bringing the wrath of McCarthyite suspicion upon him. In  the course of famously dramatic public hearings, he was stripped of his  security clearance. Drawing on original research and interviews, Monk  traces the wide range of influences on Oppenheimer&apos;s development--his  Jewishness, his social isolation at Harvard, his love of Sanskrit, his  radical politics. This definitive portrait finally solves the enigma of  the extraordinary, charming, tortured man whose beautiful mind  fundamentally reshaped the world\"--",
