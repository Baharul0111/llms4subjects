                "The Arbeitsstelle Fernstudienforschung (ASF) - the unit for distance education research at Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg - is a joint venture of the Center for Distance Education and the School of Education. In supporting research and developments in distance education one of the significant outcomes was the creation of the ASF series contributing to the overall scholarship in the field of distance education. Volume 8 with Michael Beaudoin&apos;s &apos;Reflections on Research, Faculty and Leadership in Distance Education&apos; in addition to being of general interest to practitioners and scholars in the field, also serves as a reader for students in the course Management of Distance Education 2: Leadership in D.E. in the online Master of Distance Education (MDE) program, jointly offered by the University of Maryland University College (UMUC) and Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg. Distance education is a complex approach to provide education for learners in their homes or at their workplace. It includes operational functions such as (i) identifying the target population and their needs, (ii) choosing, managing, and administering the type of system as well as the appropriate technology for the presentation of the course materials and their delivery, (iii) recruiting, enrolling, tutoring and supporting students, (iv) assessing students, (v) evaluating and assuring quality. Successful distance education practices are predominantly largescale operations and arae a significant component of educational and training systems in both developed and developing countries. &lt;engl.&gt;",
