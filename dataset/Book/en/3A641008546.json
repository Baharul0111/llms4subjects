                "The report is a contribution towards the 6th FRIEND World Conference \"Global Change: Facing Risks and Threats to Water Resources \", which takes place in Fez, Morocco, 25 to 29 October 2010. This conference brings together the FRIEND community to discuss the impacts of global change in altering the hydrological cycle in different parts of the world. The outputs of this conference will provide guidance on how to mitigate and adapt to the new risks, threats and opportunities posed to water security by global change. In 2010, UNESCO&apos;s IHP FRIEND programme marks its 25th anniversary. It is one of the most successful IHP programmes of UNESCO. From a relatively modest beginning in 1985 with scientists from 7 European countries, FRIEND expanded to 162 countries in 2010 and has thus become a global programme not only with respect to its geographical coverage but also due to is vast amount of well recognized publications in international journals and its attractive training courses for water managers around the world. FRIEND has helped to bring up a new generation of scientists working together and sharing data, scientific knowledge and techniques across political borders and enhancing benefits of learning networks. The FRIEND project has always advocated a \"bottom up approach\", with research objectives proposed by hydrologists in the region, and a steering committee providing a formal basis for maintaining co-operation and advancing links with both national and internationalresearch initiatives. A generic overarching scientific objective has been to improve the understanding of the similarity andhydrological variability across different regions of  the world and to share models and techniques between countries, organisations and researchers. The current research covers a divers range of topics including low flows, floods, variability of regimes, rainfall/runoff modelling, processes of stream flow generation, sediment transport, snow and glacier melt, climate change and variability and its uncertainties, and land-use impacts. In recent years FRIEND has increased its efforts to establish training courses for water managers and academia. Subsequently, capacity building has become a high priority for the programme. Over 447 participants from 77 different countries have been trained on various topics like low flows, floods and droughts, climate change, GIS, hydrological modelling, water quality, database, sediments, and monitoring of mass balance of glaciers. The sharing of data has always been given a high priority in the FRIEND programme. Through research activities, the FRIEND groups have established regional databases which have grown over the years and are regularly updated in order to meet new research challenges. Current activities concentrate on database harmonization and the establishment of an interface to provide Meta information on hydrological data and tofacilitate access to hydrological data in different regions of the world. Besides all constraints the FRIEND programme has faced over the past years, its broad and huge network of researchers, its excellent scientific record and its hydrological database, FRIEND is considered the most successful hydrological programme within the entire UN system and has created a new spirit of international cooperation across political boundaries. The International Hydrological Programme (IHP) of UNESCO has hosted FRIEND for over 25 years, which is unusual in times of rapid changes; UNESCO IHP is proud of the programme and thanks all the participating scientists and institutions for their excellent efforts over the years. In the past decades, FRIEND has proven to be a very dynamic programme by taking up new research challenges and helping to improve our knowledge in regional hydrology under the threat of climate change. FRIEND has also been proactive in bridging the gap between science and practice and invested into capacity building and knowledge transfer at university and water manger level. I would like to express my thanks to all the hydrologists, regional coordinators and national governments which have always enthusiastically provided the necessary support to ensure the success of the FRIEND project.  In particular, I thank Trevor Daniell (Global FRIEND Coordinator) from the University of Adelaide, Australia, for his wise leadership over the past years. My sincere thank goes to Yan Huang, Changjiang Water Resources Commission, Wuhan, China, HKH FRIEND Coordinator, who, in close cooperation with UNESCO IHP in Paris and the contributions from the regional FRIEND coordinators and the support of the Regional UNESCO offices, has compiled and edited this report. I also thank the regional coordinators for their great effort in compiling the input from their region. I am grateful to Ulrich Schroder and Andrea Wessler from the German IHP/HWRP Secretariat for their assistance and dedicated efforts in making the production of this report possible.",
