                "\"Algae are a primitive living photosynthetic form and they are the oldest living organism. In the marine ecosystem, algae are the primary producers that supplies energy required to a diverse marine organism and especially seaweed provide habitat for invertebrates and fishes. There have been significant advances in many areas of phycology. This book describes the advances related to food and nutrition of algae achieved in the last decades, also identifies gaps in the present knowledge and needs for future. The 17 chapters of the book grouped into six parts are written by phycologists. More insight on industrial exploitation of algae and their products are supported by current studies and will help academia. First part explains new technologies to improve the microalgal biomass, strain improvement and different methods of seaweed cultivation. In second part, food and nutraceutical applications of algae, food safety aspects, green nanotechnology and formulation methods for the extraction, isolation of algal functional foods are described. The third part deals with the pigments and carotenoids while the fourth part exploits the isolation and applications of hydrocolloids, nutritional implication of algal polysaccharides, characterization and bioactivities of fucoidans. In the fifth part, biomedical potential of seaweeds followed by agricultural applications of algae have been well described. It is an important resource for scholars that provide knowledge on wide range of topics. Key features 1.Covers important fields of algae right from biomass production to genetic engineering aspects of algae. 2.Useful in the field of Algal biotechnology, Aquaculture, Marine micro and Macrobiology, Microbial biotechnology, Bioprocess technology 3. Focuses on therapeutic and nutritional areas of algae\"--",
