                "This book shows you how to prevent cross-site scripting and request forgery attacks before they do damage. You&apos;ll start with the basics, simulating password upgrades and adding multiple types of authorization. As your skills grow, you&apos;ll adapt Spring Security to new architectures and create advanced OAuth2 configurations. By the time you&apos;re done, you&apos;ll have a customized Spring Security configuration that protects against threats both common and extraordinary",
                "Spring Security in Action shows you how to use Spring Security to create applications you can be confident will withstand even the most dedicated attacks. Starting with essential \"secure by design\" principles, you&apos;ll learn common software vulnerabilities and how to avoid them right from the design stage. Through hands-on projects, you&apos;ll learn to manage system users, configure secure endpoints, and use, OAuth2 and OpenID Connect for authentication and authorization.     As you go, you&apos;ll learn how to adapt Spring Security to different architectures, such as configuring Spring Security for Reactive applications and container-based applications orchestrated with Kubernetes. When you&apos;re done, you&apos;ll have a complete understanding of how to use Spring Security to protect your Java enterprise applications from common threats and attacks.    Key Features  * The principles of secure by design  * The architecture of Spring Security  * Spring Security contracts for password encoding, cryptography, and authentication  * Applying Spring Security to different architecture styles    For experienced Java developers with knowledge of other Spring tools.    About the technology   Your applications, along with the data they manage, are one of your organization&apos;s most valuable assets. No company wants their applications easily cracked by malicious attackers or left vulnerable by avoidable errors. The specialized Spring Security framework reduces the time and manpower required to create reliable authorization, authentication, and other security features for your Java enterprise software. Thanks to Spring Security, you can easily bake security into your applications, from design right through to implementation.
