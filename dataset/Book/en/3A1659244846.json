                "jQuery is often referred to as the &apos;write less, do more&apos; JavaScript library. It allows a few clear lines of elegant, well-tested, code to replace many pages of complex hand-coded script, speeding development times and providing substantial cost savings. You will find jQuery 2 Recipes&apos; problem-solution approach to be an excellent value and a feature-packed resource as you begin to include jQuery in your own projects. This book is bursting with fully-worked example recipes showing the core jQuery frameworks (jQuery, jQuery Mobile, jQuery UI) in action. Starting with fundamental principals and progressing to more advanced topics you&apos;ll be shown how to make the very best use of jQuery every step of the way. Early on, you&apos;ll learn to work confidently with dynamic data  and to handle the jQuery events that form the foundation of your application. We&apos;ll then build on this foundation to demonstrate how fully working user-interface animations and AJAX data-validation can be constructed within jQuery. We&apos;ll show how add-on libraries like jQwidgets can be deployed to create professional quality apps for both the desktop and web with minimal coding. Finally, a full set of debugging and error-handling recipes is included to help you track down bugs and ensure your code is as robust as it can be",
