            "abstract": "\"Iris Murdoch was a philosopher and novelist of extraordinary breadth and originality whose work defies simple categorisation. Her philosophical writing engages with an astonishingly wide range of figures from Plato and Kant to Sartre and Derrida and her work continues to inspire debates in ethics, the philosophy of art and aesthetics, religion and literature. The Murdochian Mind is an outstanding reference source to the full span of Murdoch&apos;s work, comprising thirty-seven specially commissioned chapters written by an international team of leading scholars. Divided into five clear parts, the volume covers the following areas: Life and context Murdoch&apos;s engagement with the history of philosophy, including Plato, Kant, Hegel, Heidegger and Wittgenstein  Murdoch&apos;s key philosophical texts and novels, including The Sovereignty of Good and Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals Core themes and concepts in Murdoch&apos;s philosophy Art, Philosophy and literature Murdoch and interdisciplinary connections, including Buddhism and Christianity  Murdoch and contemporary philosophical debates, including feminism, virtue ethics and metaethics Murdoch and applied moral philosophy, including animal ethics, medical ethics and the environment. Although recent years have seen a blossoming of interest in Murdoch&apos;s philosophy, The Murdochian Mind is the first volume to do justice to the incredibly rich and wide-ranging nature of her work. As such it will be of great interest to students of philosophy, especially ethics and aesthetics, as well as those in related disciplines such as Literature, Religion and Gender Studies\"--",
