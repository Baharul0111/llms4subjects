                "Biophysics is the science of physical principles underlying all processes of life, including the dynamics and kinetics of biological systems.  This fully revised 2nd English edition is an introductory text that spans all steps of biological organization, from the molecular, to the organism level, as well as influences of environmental factors. In response to the enormous progress recently made, especially in theoretical and molecular biophysics, the author has updated the text, integrating new results and developments concerning protein folding and dynamics, molecular aspects of membrane assembly and transport, noise-enhanced processes, and photo-biophysics. The advances made in theoretical biology in the last decade call for a fully new conception of the corresponding sections. Thus, the book provides the background needed for fundamental training in biophysics and, in addition, offers a great deal of advanced biophysical knowledge.  Born in Jena, Germany in 1935. Studied biology at the Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Ph.D. in 1961, qualified as a lecturer in 1965. From 1958 to 1961, scientist at the Atomic Energy Agency in Berlin (research: aquatic radioecology), and from 1962 to 1965 scientist at the Institute of Cardiology, Academy of Science in Berlin (with a focus on ion transport). From 1965 to 1970 assistant professor in Jena, from 1970 to 2000 full professor of biophysics at the Humboldt University, Berlin (research: biophysics of cell surfaces, shape and ionic states of erythrocytes, electro-manipulation of cells). In 1977 vice-president and from 1981 to 1985 president of the Society of Physical and Mathematical Biology of the GDR, from 1990 to 1992 dean of the Faculty of Science at the Humboldt University. Roland Glaser was a member of the UNESCO European expert committee on biophysics (1976 - 1988), since 1978 a member of various commissions of the council of IUPAB, council member of EBEA (1993 - 1996) and of the national commission on radiation protection at the German Federal Ministry of Environmental Protection (1992 - 1998 and 2008 - 2010). He has also worked as an emeritus adviser for various organizations in the field of electromagnetic safety. This book is the result of over thirty-five years of teaching. Following the first German edition in 1971, the textbook was continuously revised and updated in line with his experience from teaching as well as innumerable discussions with students and colleagues. The fourth German edition was published in 1996, and a fifth revised version was then published as the first English edition in 2001. With this revised second English edition, the author reflects the enormous strides made in biophysics, especially in the fields of molecular and theoretical biophysics. While the book remains a basic textbook and provides the introductory background needed for fundamental training in biophysics, it also offers new insights into recent advances in biophysical knowledge.",
