                "Alan Rogers looks at learning (formal, nonformal and informal) and examines the hidden world of informal (unconscious, unplanned) learning. He points out the importance of informal learning for creating tacit attitudes and values, knowledge and skills which influence (conscious, planned) learning – formal and non-formal. Moreover, he explores the implications of informal learning for educational planners and teachers in the context of lifelong learning. While mainly aimed at adult educators, the book’s arguments apply also to schooling and higher education, in both industrialised societies and developing countries where large numbers of children and adults are not and have not been in school and so rely on informal learning to manage change.",
                "[...] I would strongly recommend this book to all adult educators in general because as Rogers concludes, “Without informal learning, none of us would grow; and without the products of informal learning, none of our planned learning programmes would be effective” (p. 79). Adult Education Quarterly 66/2016 In conclusion, Rogers calls for a revision of the way we look at learning in order to cease interpreting it as what happens in agency-organised contexts and open its meaning to all learning, with special attention to what goes on outside plannedlearning experiences. International Review of Education 61/2015 The base of the iceberg [...] is a thick and deep theoretical discussion on education by Alan Rogers, a well-known author in the field.
