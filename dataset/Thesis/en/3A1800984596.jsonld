                "Background: A large body of research indicates that the cognitions individuals have about their own age and aging, so called self-perceptions of aging (SPA), predict health and wellbeing in later life. However, much less is known about associations of SPA with developmental correlates such as personality. Some initial studies have found cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of the Big Five traits (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) with SPA. Building on these findings, this thesis aimed at advancing knowledge on associations of personality with SPA. To this end, cross-sectional associations of the meta-traits of agency, i.e., a focus on the self, and communion, i.e., a focus on others, with SPA were examined in study 1, and longitudinal associations of agentic and communal personal values with SPA were examined in study 2. Study 3 aimed at expanding findings of previous studies on associations of SPA with selfreported physical function to an objective indicator of physical function, namely, gait pattern. In all studies, SPA were treated as a multidimensional construct comprising gains and losses. Methods: Study 1 was based on data of 154 adults aged 75 and older that were recruited in hospital. Data was collected one month after recruitment. In regression analyses, associations of agentic and communal traits with SPA beyond health were examined. Study 2 was based on data of 6,089 adults aged 40 and older enrolled ..."
