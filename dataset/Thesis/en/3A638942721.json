                "The aim of this study was to invistigate the effect of the oral health component of a general health promoting program implemented in primary schools of Greifswald city and east Pomerania region. Methods: This program was part of an innovative multidisciplinary general health promoting program, a longitudinal collaborative project based on health competence concept. Seven hundred and forty students with an age range 9-12 years (mean 10.34, SD±0.56, 48% females) were recruited from the fifth grade students of different 18 primary schools. The schools were randomly allocated into two groups. Oral health education was provided to the teachers in the intervention schools and then they conveyed it to their students, while no additional measures were conducted in the control schools. School dental examinations as well as questionnaires for the students and their parents were conducted at baseline and after one and half year of the program. Results: A significant correlation between caries increment and intervention/control group was reported, with a 35% higher risk in the control group. High socio-economic status has a significant highly protective effect in the intervention program with a reduction in incidence risk ratio of 94% (p &lt; 0.001)...",
