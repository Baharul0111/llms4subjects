                "In this study, BVDV mutants with deletions, insertions or substitutions in the E(rns)-encoding genomic region were generated on the basis of the infectious cDNA clones pA/BVDV and pA/BVDV/Ins- (Meyers et al., 1996). Most of the changes within the E(rns)-encoding region were lethal and therefore non-essential regions for the generation of infectious virions could not been defined. The only exception was the substitution of amino acids 105-108 which was tolerated in combination with adaptive mutations. With the help of recombinant cell lines, constitutively expressing the BVDV structural proteins, a mutant with a complete E(rns) deletion and an internal EMCV-IRES could be successfully trans-complemented and DISC viruses were generated. Furthermore, plasmids for the expression of the BVDV structural proteins (C, E(rns), E1, E2) were generated. With the help of those constructs, an E(rns)-E1 protein with 60-65 kDa, which remained stable for at least 3 h in transfected cells, was identified. Mutation of the P3 position of a putative SPP motif in pCITE-2a(+) as well as in BVDV full length mutants abolished cleavage of the E(rns)-E1 protein. Therefore, it could be demonstrated that cleavage of the E(rns)-E1 protein is essential for the generation of infectious virus progeny. With bicistronic mutants it could further be shown that the E(rns)-E1 protein itself is not essential but beneficial for the generation of infectious virions. Furthermore, with a ..."
