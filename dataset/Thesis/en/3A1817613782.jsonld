                "Forests influence the climate of our Earth and provide habitat and food for many species and resources for human use. These valuable ecosystems are threatened by fast environmental changes caused by human-induced climte change. Negative growth responses and higher tree mortality rates were associated with increasing physiological stress induced by global warming. Especially boreal forests at high latitudes in the arctic region are threatened, a region predicted to undergo the highest increase in temperature during the next decades. Therefore, it is important to assess the adaptation potential in trees. For this purpose, I studied natural populations of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) in Alaska. In this thesis, I present three scientific papers in which my co-authors and I studied the phenotypic plasticity and genetic basis of tree growth, wood anatomy and drought tolerance as well as the genetic structure of white spruce populations in contrasting environments. We established three sites representing two cold-limited treelines and one drought-limited treeline with a paired plot design including one plot located at the treeline and one plot located in a closed-canopy forest, respectively. Additionally, the study design included one forest plot as reference. Within the entire project, in total 3,000 trees were measured, genotyped and dendrochronological data was obtained. I used several approaches to estimate the neutral and adaptive genetic diversity and phenotypic ..."
