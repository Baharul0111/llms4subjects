                "Pittosporum angustifolium Lodd. (Pittosporaceae) is a small tree that endemically grows in most inland areas of Australia. The species is colloquially referred to as \"gumby gumby\" and preparations of this plant are used in the field of ethnomedicine for the treatment of numerous disorders and deseases, such as pains, cramps, coughs and dermatosis. Recently, also in the field of complementary medicine it is used for a supplementary treatment of malignant deseases. The aim of the present dissertation was to characterize the genuine phytochemistry of Pittosporum angustifolium and, furthermore, to investigate potential biological activities of extracts, fractions and isolated pure compounds. Except two basic diploma projects, no scientific work have been published at the time of the beginning of this investigation (january 2010). Concerning the phytochemical section of this study, from Australian plant material (leaves and seeds) as well as from self grown plants (leaves) a total of 55 triterpene saponins were isolated. 33 thereof were completely structurally elucidated. Finally, 29 compounds, named pittangretosides A-Z and A1-C1, were characterized as new natural products and are reported here for the fist time. The aglycone backbones are consisting of the oleanane, an unusual 17,22-seco oleanolic acid and the taraxasterol type which are linked to one or two sugar chains, creating mono- and bisdesmosidic structures, respectively. In all investigated parts of the plant (leaves, ..."
