                "In this thesis an artificial enzyme cascade consisting of an ADH from Lactobacillus kefir, a CHMO from Acinetobacter sp. NCIMB 9871 and lipase A from Candida antarctica has been investigated for the biocatalytic synthesis of the bulk chemical e-caprolactone as well as several derivatives for their direct utilization as polymer building blocks. Due to major limitations, which hamper such a biocatalytic route, the first addressed demand in this work was the improvement of the stability of the CHMO. By structure-guided engineering, distinctively improved variants concerning the resistance against oxidation as well as temperature stability without compromising the catalytic activity were successfully created. Due to the incomplete knowledge of the mechanisms that lead to thermal and/or oxidative inactivation of enzymes, this study illustrates that the selection of mutations for increased protein stability is still hard to predict. Thus, these results can serve as a basis for further stability studies on this enzyme class to give better insights into the underlying mechanisms, which determine the stability of an enzyme. Such a highly stabilized biocatalyst will pave the way for the successful use of flavin-dependent enzymes for industrial applications. A further aim of this thesis was dedicated to the second major hurdle en route to polyester precursors represented by the product inhibition and enzyme deactivation caused by e-caprolactone, particularly at higher concentrations ...",
