                "Based on a sample libary that was created within this work the present study systematically investigated the expression, localization and function of membrane transporters of pharmacological and physiological relevance For this, mRNA, protein and genomic DNA was isolated from 70 human placentas and mRNA expression of the following membrane transporters was determined: ABCB1 (P-gp), ABCC1 (MRP1), ABCC2 (MRP2), ABCC3 (MRP3), (ABCC5), ABCG2 (BCRP), SLC10A6 (SOAT), SLC22A4 (OCTN1), SLC22A5 (OCTN2), SLC22A11 (OAT4) and SLCO2B1 (OATP2B1). The results were analyzed for association with gestational age and sex of the fetus respectively and a statistically significant decrease of P-gp, BCRP, OATP2B1 and OAT4 with gestational age was detected, whereas expression of MRP1 in placentas of male fetuses was significantly increased comparing to female fetuses. Since almost all organs but liver, kidney and brain rely on carnitine uptake from the blood, carnitine transporters such as the SLC22A4 (OCTN1) and SLC22A5 (OCTN2) play a crucial role: In the placenta they are of high relevance for the supply of the fetus with essential L-carnitine. However, the present study could not demonstrate any changes of gene expression in terms of variations in mRNA level, although the fetus has a significantly increased carnitine requirement at the end of pregnancy. In addition the corresponding OCTN2 protein expression actually showed an increased transporter expression at the end of pregnancy which does not correlate with the mRNA expression. Concerning OCTN2, further investigations were performed on the influence of a the promoter polymorphism -207G&gt;C, which in other studies was associated with the OCTN2 expression."
