                "Thiol or sulfhydryl groups are highly reactive functional groups in cellular systems. Molecules carrying thiol groups are mostly derivatives of the amino acid cysteine and are grouped as low molecular weight (LMW)-thiols: coenzyme A (CoA), glutathione (GSH) or bacillithiol (BSH). LMW-thiols can help in the maintenance of the reduced cellular environment as so called redox-buffers. Additionally, they act as co-factors in enzyme reactions or help in the detoxification of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species, electrophilic compounds or thiophilic metalloids (arsenite, tellurite). In proteins from different organisms cysteine is underrepresented compared to other amino acids, but still overtakes diverse roles. It is an important determinant in the tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins. The nucleophilic character of the thiol or thiolate group, respectively, makes cysteine the catalytically active amino acids of different enzymes. As a precursor cysteine participates in the formation of Fe-S clusters and coordinates different co-factors like heme, iron or zinc. The main goal of this study was the investigation of the different cellular thiol pools, now defined as the thiolome. The thiolome is the entity of the cellular thiol pools, i.e. LMW-thiols and protein thiols, and the dynamics between these pools. In Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus mixed disulfides between protein thiols and free LMW-thiols, so called S-thiolations, were identified ...",
