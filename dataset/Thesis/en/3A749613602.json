                "Within the scope of this work the selection and characterization of aptamers targeting platelet factor 4 (PF4) was realized. PF4 is a small cytokine, which is involved in the heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a serious autoimmune disease while its biological function remains obscure to this point. Aptamers possess a wide application spectrum, which includes functional studies of proteins and therapeutic approaches. For this purpose, two separate selections were carried out while the first one stood under the premise of identifying secondary structure elements that are particularly prone to interact with PF4. This information might be helpful to facilitate the development of aptamers as therapeutic tools, since this could give early information if potential therapeutic aptames might show cross ractivity with PF4 and might therefore have immunogenic effects. After the selection we were able to identifiy mainly aptamers that form 3- and 4-way junctions, respectively, and developed a model which explains why these structures in particular form large, multimolecular complexes with PF4. To get an idea which of the selected aptamers forms more stable complexes with PF4, they were qualitatively analyzed using the gel shift assay. Under high NaCl-concentrations five of the selected aptamers were capable of binding PF4 and their complex stability was investigated using photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS). Based on the sequence of the best binder, identified in the PCS ..."
