                "In the 1940s cytochrome P450 monooxygenases have been discovered and have been the focus of many studies ever since. Although they catalyze very interesting reactions that might find applications in the production of fine chemicals or pharmaceuticals, their low activity and stability often reduces their economic value. Both properties, the activity and the stability, are influenced by the uncoupling of the catalytic cycle. In this PhD thesis, an assay for the screening of activity and uncoupling of cytochrome P450 enzymes was successfully developed. After finding optimal conditions for the assay, concerning pH and enzyme concentration, the uncoupling of cytochrome P450 BM3 and five mutants (F87Y, R47L, Y51F, A82L and T268A) was investigated. With the results obtained, a comparison of data from literature was possible and revealed similarities. Additionally, through negative controls, the reliability of the assay could be further demonstrated. Although other methods have been described for the detection of hydrogen peroxide formation, the combination of NADPH consumption measurement and hydrogen peroxide formation in parallel was new and represents a very good basis for a pre-screening of large mutant libraries, followed by closer investigation of selected variants. For the investigation of the activity of the CYP11A1 system, consisting of CYP11A1 and Adx and AdR as redox partner system, the expression and purification for all three proteins was investigated first.
