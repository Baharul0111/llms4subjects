                "The aim of this study is to investigate evolutionary relations in and between the different species of sea gulls (Laridae) more clearly. This investigation on gull relationship is based on DNA-sequences - mitochondrial regions as well as nuclear intron sequences. With a molecular approach in my study the use of broad ranged and not to small data sets is of essential importance. Also consideration of homolog sequences and robustness in the total alignments were done. The study is a conclusion of six main topics: 1. Phylogeny of gulls This study shows a clearly improved larid phylogeny revealing deficiencies of previous studies (small taxon sampling and small / uninformative data sets). Based on my results it can be accepted that a split in basic gulls (seven genera), and genus Larus (six genetically differentiated sub groups) can be made. Good supports were obtained for all six Larus sub groups. As expected the relations in the youngest group of large white headed gulls could not be clarified in this topic using the sequence data. To better resolve their assemblage other molecular markers has to be find and used. Important was the occurrence of a signal connecting the basic gull taxa together - a deletion in LDH-sequences. It will heplto find further suspected group members I was not able to investigate in my study. 2. AFLP-study in large white-headed gulls Vos et al..."
