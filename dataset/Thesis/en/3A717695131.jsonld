                "The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) interaction with plants has a major impact on the soil ecosystem. However, so far, only a few studies on AMF genetics have been performed and molecular information on the genetic diversity of AMF is limited. In this study a fundamental genetic characterization of the industrial isolate, Glomus sp. AMykor (AMykor GmbH, Bitterfeld, Germany) has been undertaken to increase the understanding of AMF genetic diversity. Based on phylogenetic analysis of partial rDNA sequences, Glomus sp. AMykor isolate was proposed to belong to the G. irregulare species together with the reference isolate, DAOM197198. To investigate if both isolates differ in their ploidy level, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed and mainly one or two hybridization signals per nucleus were observed in both isolates. It is suggested that they harbour at least two major rDNA sites and possibly two minor sites. The DNA content was estimated by means of flow cytometry (FC) and confirmed by Feulgen densitometry (FD). The calculated average DNA content per nucleus is 153.0 ± 3.6 Mb for the G. irregulare AMykor isolate and 154.8 ± 6.2 Mb for the DAOM197198 isolate. Since there are plenty criticisms coming recently of using rDNA sequence for fungal barcoding there is necessity of development other system for the identification to species level of ..."
