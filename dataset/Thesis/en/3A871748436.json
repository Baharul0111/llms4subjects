                "The present work examines the decision-making process of clinicians and managers in terms of pricing. This dissertation attempts to make often unconscious processes in both the clinical and economic areas more transparent. Due to this increase in transparency and an illustration of the overall decision-making process, a prioritization of the decision-drivers is enabled. Similarily, overall decision-making on stakeholder level is improved. The findings of this work are based on a dual sample: The paper primarily combines qualitative expert discussions in the clinical field with a quantitative manager survey. Therefore, the advancement of knowledge is specifically furthered in terms of pricing decision-making, as well as specific economic and thematic aspects. These form the basis for clinical/managerial decision-making. Since such specific understanding enables better acting and reacting during the negotiation processs, clients of medical device companies (eg clinics) could additionally benefit from improved understanding. Although the focus of this work rests on the clinical area, this paper also examines how companies of the medical technology industry could offer more economic medical products by means of using the instrument of pricing. Based on an interdisciplinary approach and a collection of primary data, this work also discusses a solution approach for corporate/entrepreneurial inefficiencies discovered in this paper. A final conceptual model illustrates different ..."
