                "This thesis describes the cross-linking of different substance classes by laccase. The synthesized compounds can be used not only as fine chemicals in organic synthesis but also for the production of antimicrobial and anticancer drugs or functional biomaterials. Potential of laccase for the production of bioactive agents: The synthesis of antibacterial agents through laccase-catalyzed derivatization focused mainly on different azoles and morpholines. The isolated derivatives were studied for their biological effects. Azoles and morpholines are part of various antifungal drugs and fungicides. A derivatization of these compounds could result in new substances with new properties, e.g. a broader antifungal spectrum. Synthesis of potential drugs 1. For laccase-mediated derivatization of azoles and morpholines para-dihydroxylated aromatic compounds were used as starting materials. The first step is the laccase-catalyzed oxidation of the respective para-dihydroxylated aromatic substance with oxygen, resulting in quinonoid derivatives which then undergo an amination by intermolecular Michael addition(1,4-addition). The formed C-N monoaminated products may undergo a further laccase-mediated oxidation and subsequent amination resulting in diaminated products. 2. In addition, the synthesis of novel cyclic products with laccase was demonstrated for the first time. The most important of these new groups are cycloheptenes and cyclooctenes. Testing of the potential drugs for their biological effects 3. A modified method of EUCAST discussion document E. Dis 7.1 was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized products against Candida maltosa and Candida albicans. The MIC values of selected products and the reactants used for their synthesis against the test organisms Candida albicans and Candida maltosa were comparable ...",
