            "abstract": [
                "Protein quality control systems are essential for the viability and growth of all living organisms. They protect the cell from irreversible protein aggregation. Because the frequency of protein misfolding, which ultimately results in protein aggregation, varies with the environmental conditions, the amount and activity of protein quality systems have to be accurately adapted to the rate of protein misfolding. The main goal of this thesis was to gain detailed molecular insights into the transcriptional and post-translational regulation of these protein quality control networks in the ecologically, medically and industrially important phylum of low GC, Gram-positive bacteria. In these bacteria the core protein quality control systems are under the transcriptional control of the global repressor CtsR. In a first study it was demonstrated that the arginine kinase McsB is not responsible for the regulation of CtsR activity during heat stress, as was concluded by others on the basis of previous in vitro data. Rather, it was demonstrated that CtsR acts as an intrinsic thermosensor that adapts its activity to the surrounding temperature. CtsR displays a decreased DNA binding at higher temperatures, which leads to induction of transcription of the protein quality control systems under these conditions. This CtsR feature is conserved in all low GC, Gram-positive bacteria. However, the CtsR proteins of various low GC, Gram-positive species do not have the same temperature optima. CtsR responds to heat ...",
