                "The main issue of this thesis was the investigation of dusty plasmas in magnetic fields. We made use of spherical paramagnetic as well as non-magnetic plastic particles in the micrometer range, so-called dust particles. The particles were then trapped in the sheath region of the driven lower electrode of an rf discharge. The plasma chamber was surrounded by coils to apply a horizontal magnetic field with field strengths of up to B=50mT at the particles’ position. In this configuration the sheath electric field and the external magnetic field were perpendicular to each other. Only the electrons could be magnetized but this leads to several forces acting on the dust particles. In some aspects the dust clusters with the magnetic particles show a behavior that is in complete contrast to those consisting of the standard non-magnetic plastic particles. Both types of particles have in common that the dust clusters were found to move either towards the positive or negative ExB-direction as a reaction to the magnetic field. Whether the positive or negative direction was preferred depended on the experimental conditions. The forces that lead to this transport are plasma-based forces induced by the magnetic field. These investigations were performed on two-dimensional horizontal particle systems. Vertically aligned dust particles due to the ion focus interaction have also been studied to determine the influence of horizontal magnetic fields on the stability of such dust pairs. Under ...",
