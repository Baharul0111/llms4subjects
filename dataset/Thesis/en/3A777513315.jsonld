                "The investigated bacterial strain 64G3 was isolated from an offshore oil reservoir in Vung Tau, Vietnam. By means of 16S rDNA sequence alignment and DNA-DNA hybridization with Petrotoga mexicana DSM 14811, the isolate was identified as Petrotoga mexicana species. Morphologically, the 64G3 cells were rod-shaped and cell sizes varied widely from 1.0 æm up to 60 æm in length and from 0.6 to 1.2 æm in width. The cells appeared single, pairwise or in chains within a sheath-like structure (a typical characteristic of the order Thermotogales) that ballooned over the cell ends. Cells were immobile and no flagella were observed. Strain 64G3 grew anaerobically at temperatures ranging from 30 to 65C and within the pH range of 5.0 to 8.5 with optimum growth at 55C and the pH 7.0. Elemental sulfur and thiosulfate served as alternative electron acceptors whereas sulfate did not. Cellular extract of strain 64G3 grown in a basal medium containing soluble starch displayed hydrolytic activity towards soluble starch. The amylase system includes at least two individual enzymes. Amylase activity of the cell extract was detected in a wide temperature range (30-80C), with optimal enzyme activity at 75C. By using degenerate primer for PCR amplification of GH13 enzyme coding regions in combination with other molecular methods, a full amylase coding gene containing four conserved regions of -amylase was obtained. The deduced sequence showed low identities ...",
