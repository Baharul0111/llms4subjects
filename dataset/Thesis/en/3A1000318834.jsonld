                "The content of this thesis can be summarized as follows: (i) The deposition processes of SiOx and SiOxCyHz coatings were investigated in a low-pressure, low temperature HMDSO-O2-N2 plasmas. Infrared laser absorption spectroscopy (IRLAS) and optical emission spectroscopy (OES) were combined to measure the gas temperatures in the hot and colder zones of the plasma as well as to monitor the concentration of the methyl radical, CH3, and of seven stable molecules, HMDSO, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, CO and CO2. Tunable lead salt diode lasers (TDLs) and an external-cavity quantum cascade laser (EC-QCL) were simultaneously employed as radiation sources to perform the IRLAS measurements. They were found to be in the range between 10^{11} to 10^{15} cm^{−3}. The influence of the discharge parameters of power, pressure and gas mixture on the molecular concentrations was studied. The plasma generation is characterized by a certain degree of inhomogeneity with different temperature zones, i.e., hottest, hot and colder zones depending on the construction of the reactor. This complexity is characterized by the multiple molecular species including the HMDSO precursor and products in ground and excited states existing in the plasma. (ii) Employing similarly IRLAS and OES techniques, the deposition of nanocrystalline diamond at relatively low temperature in low-pressure MW H2 plasmas with small ad-mixtures of methane and carbon dioxide was investigated. Five methods were applied for an extensive ..."
