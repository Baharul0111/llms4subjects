                "In this study, interactions of Rabies virus polymerase L and Hendra virus matrix protein M with cellular proteins and intracellular structures have been investigated. With ASS1 and DLC1, two cellular proteins have been identified that either directly or indirectly interact with the enzymatically active subunit L of the Rabies virus (RABV) polymerase complex. Cell culture based assays did not indicate any influence of ASS1 on RABV replication and a discussion about possible interference with nitric oxid synthesis in infected organisms remained theoretical. However, it was shown for the first time, that the L protein contains a consensus binding motif for DLC1 and that this motif has an impact on efficient viral primary transcription. Moreover, comparative studies with virus mutants in which the identified motif in L and the already described DLC1-binding motif in P have been mutated, showed that both motifs influence primary transcription of the virus in a comparable manner. However, a combination of both mutations had no additive effect on the polymerase activity. Because of these data it was hypothesized that functionality of the polymerase complex P/L in primary transcription depends on an interaction of DLC1 with both components of the RABV polymerase complex. Quantitative analysis of the distribution of virus particles after penetration of cells showed, that an accumulation of viral ribonucleoproteins (RNP) depended on the presence of an intact DLC1-binding motif in P and ...",
