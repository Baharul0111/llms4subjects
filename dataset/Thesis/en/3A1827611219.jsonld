                "Enzymes are well-known for being remarkably selective catalysts. They are often able to catalyse reactions for certain molecules while leaving other similar molecules completely unchanged. Nevertheless, many enzymes are capable of catalysing other reactions and/or transforming other substrates than their physiologically relevant activities. This phenomenon is referred to as enzyme promiscuity and it is thought to play an important role in the emergence of novel functions by providing a starting point for divergent evolution towards different enzymatic activities. It is important for enzymes to be selective to avoid harmful side-products and increase reaction efficiency, but often catalysts are not optimised beyond what is required for their function. Life profits from the cross-reactivity and enzyme promiscuity through accidental discovery of new helpful molecules and pathways, while using regulation to quickly adapt to changing circumstances. Enzymes are grouped together with other similar proteins into structural families and superfamilies. Members of a structural family share significant structural elements and often have similar catalytic mechanisms. However, they often catalyse very different chemical reactions and accept a variety of different substrates. Promiscuous activities are common within superfamilies, where the primary function of one family member is often found as promiscuous activity in other family members. Together with the structural similarities, this ...",
