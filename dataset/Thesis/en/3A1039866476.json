In Mexico, the prevalence data are inadequate and underestimate the problem. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of domestic violence against pregnant women and the socio-demographic risk factors for domestic violence against pregnant women. 311 women were interviewed in the prenatal care department of the University Clinic Dr. José González Eleuterio in Monterrey, Mexico, from July to December 2011.

Factors that significantly increased the risk to pregnant women of becoming victims of domestic violence were: smoking, alcohol and drug use by the women and drug use by the partner, perceived high levels of stress, lack of support from other family members during pregnancy, and having experienced domestic violence between their parents during childhood.
