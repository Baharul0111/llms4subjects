                "In the first part of this work, an a/ß-hydrolase was to be engineered by exchanging several amino acids to produce haloalkane dehalogenase (HLD) activity. As model enzyme served the aryl esterase PFE from Pseudomonas fluorescens, whose cap-domain consists, like those from HLDs, of a-Helices. In case of the HLDs the subfamilies HLD-I and HLD-II were used. Their members differ in their catalytic triads and in some other residues that participate in the catalytic reaction. On the other hand they catalyze the same reaction and do not differ in their catalytic mechanisms. With the help of sequence and structure alignments of PFE and some HLDs conserved regions within the HLDs were identified. For generating HLD activity, the essential halide-stabilizing residues apart from the catalytic triad had to be introduced in PFE. Subfamilies HLD-I and HLD-II show differences in the catalytic triad as well as in the halide-stabilizing residues, which resulted in different s ets of hotpots. On the basis of a simple mutant, 4.000 mutants were generated and analyzed with the help of error-prone PCR. Another approach for generating HLD activity was based on a saturation mutagenesis at the halide-stabilizing residues, where another 765 variants were created. None of the mutants generated neither by rational design nor by directed evolution showed any activity. The reason for the problems in creating HLD activity is probably found in the most variable part of the HLDs ..."
