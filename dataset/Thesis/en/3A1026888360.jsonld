                "Psychological health is a result of the effective interplay between explicit and implicit attempts to regulate ones’ emotions (Koole &amp; Rothermund, 2011). Emotion regulation refers to processes that influence the intensity, the duration and the type of emotion experienced (Gross &amp; Thompson, 2007). While explicit emotion regulation comprises effortful mental processes, implicit emotion regulation refers to processes that require no monitoring and terminate automatically (Gyurak, Gross, &amp; Etkin, 2011). In the present thesis, explicit and implicit strategies to regulate emotions were investigated. In Study 1, a well-established paradigm (Gross &amp; Levenson, 1993) was adapted to examine the up- and down-regulation of positive and negative emotions using two different explicit emotion regulation strategies. To infer on the neurobiological correlates, blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) brain activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance tomography. Furthermore, as a trait marker for the individual ability to regulate emotions, heart rate variability (HRV) was acquired during rest. In Study 2, implicit emotion regulation was examined. Therefore, a well-established fear extinction paradigm was compared to a novel approach based on the integration of new information during reconsolidation (Schiller et al., 2010). Autonomic arousal was measured via the skin conductance response during fear acquisition, fear extinction and after fear reinstatement. In Study 3, two ..."
