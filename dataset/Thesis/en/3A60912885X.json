                "In the present work, mass determinations of the eleven neutron-deficient nuclides (99-109)Cd, of ten neutron-rich silver nuclides (112-114,121,123)Ag, and seven neutron-rich cadmium nuclides (114,120,122-124,126,128)Cd are reported. Due to the clean production of the neutron-deficient nuclides it was possible to reduce the experimental uncertainties down to 2 keV, whereas the measurements of neutron-rich nuclides were hampered by the presence of contaminations from more stable In and Cs nuclides. In the case of 99Cd and 123Ag the masses were determined for the first time and for the other nuclides the mass uncertainties could be reduced by up to a factor of 50 as in the case of 100Cd. In the case of a potential isomeric mixture as for (115,117,119)Ag and 123Cd, where no assignment to either the ground state or the excited state was possible, the experimental results were adjusted accordingly. Afterwards all results were included in the framework of the atomic-mass evaluation and thus linked and compared with other experimental data. In the case of the neutron-deficient Cd nuclides a conflict between the mass values obtained in the present work and those published by the JYFLTRAP group could be solved by performing an atomic-mass evaluation ...",
