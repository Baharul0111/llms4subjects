                "Main drivers for biodiversity loss in terrestrial ecosystems are changes in land use, climate change, enhanced nitrogen deposition and biotic exchange (invasive species). These drivers also affect dry, nutrient-poor open anthropo-zoogenic inland and coastal heathlands which often harbor a high biodiversity. To counteract biodiversity loss in coastal ecosystems, a basic step is the assessment of the various threats. Therefore it is important to select suitable model organisms for analyses of biodiversity dynamics. In this thesis the three arthropod groups Orthoptera (Ensifera and Caelifera), carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and spiders (Araneae) were studied, as they are very useful indicators. Besides sampling of the three arthropod groups vegetation and microclimate parameters were recorded. The studies were done between 2008 and 2010 in the coastal heathland on the Baltic island of Hiddensee, Germany. The main aim of the thesis was to analyze the impact of three drivers of heathland biodiversity loss (succession, grass encroachment, moss invasion) on the selected indicator arthropod groups. Based on this multi-level and -species approach, implications for the conservation of coastal heathlands are given. The results show that successional processes and grass encroachment have strong impact on species richness and abundance, species composition and functional groups, as well as life-history traits and functional diversity of the arthropod groups ..."
