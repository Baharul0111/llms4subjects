                "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage all cellular macromolecules and also produce secondary reactive intermediates, like reactive electrophilic species (RES) that include quinones or aldehydes. Low molecular weight (LMW) thiols are small thiol-containing compounds that play essential roles in the defense against ROS and RES in all organisms. The best studied LMW thiol is the tripeptide glutathione (GSH). Firmicutes bacteria including Bacillus und Staphylococcus species have been recently discovered to utilize the redox buffer bacillithiol (BSH). LMW thiols function as redox buffers to maintain the reduced state of the cytoplasm. Under conditions of oxidative stress, LMW thiols also react with protein thiols to form mixed LMW thiol - protein disulfides, termed S-thiolations, as major protection mechanism. Investigating the role of BSH in oxidative stress response and ROS-induced S-thiolations in Firmicutes bacteria was one subject of this PhD thesis. Specifically, the regulatory mechanisms and post-translational thiol-modifications in response to NaOCl stress were studied in the model bacterium for low-GC Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis. The transcriptome profile after NaOCl stress was indicative of disulfide stress and overlapped strongly with the response to diamide. NaOCl stress caused induction of the thiol- and oxidative stress-specific Spx, CtsR, PerR and OhrR regulons. Thiol redox proteomics identified only few NaOCl-sensitive proteins with reversible ..."
