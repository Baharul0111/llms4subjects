                "Palladin, an actin associated protein that plays an important role for cell morphology, migration, adhesion and polarity. Palladin could be associated with the ability of malign tumors to metastasize in recent studies. The investigation of the role of palladin in vivo within the mouse model is not possible because of its intrauterine lethal phenotype. That is why we studied the zebrafish as a new model organism for the investigation of palladin in vivo in this publication. We created a knockdown due to Morpholino antisense technology. The down regulation of palladin was proofed via Western Blot and RT-PCR. Analogues to the mouse model a knockdown of palladin led to a lethal phenotype at 11-18 hours post fertilization due to severe impairment of development. For further examinations we created a so called mosaic phenotype. Within those animals we could show a disruption in actin in the Myotoms of the larvae. We could show that at a time point of 6-8.5 hpf the migration of cells was altered and cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts were instable. Through a Gene Array analysis of the knockdown larvae at 10 hpf we could demonstrate that 1335 of 8200 proteins were altered significantly depending on the level of palladin expression. Within these altered proteins there were important proteins for regulation of actin cytoskeleton, cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts. Summarizing we could show that the zebrafish presents as an ideal model for the investigation of palladins role in vivo.",
