                "The goal of this thesis was to study the systematic relationships within the superfamily Sylvioidea (Aves: Passeriformes) in general and within the closely related families Acrocephalidae and Locustellidae in particular, by means of DNA sequences. Sylvioidea itself and families therein were the focus of many studies based as well on morphological characters as on DNA. Due to their morphological similarity and their presumably rapid radiation most studies failed to solve relationships between sylvioidean families and also demarcations of single families and relations within are still in progress. In this study, an enlargement of previous datasets, both taxa and number of DNA sequences, and more sophisticated analysis methods were used to improve the resolution in Sylvioidea, Acrocephalidae and Locustellidae. In addition, the applicability of barcoding in Acrocephalidae was tested. The monophyly of Sylvioidea could be supported and the families Paridae and Remizidae, which were sometimes still included, clustered among the outgroup taxa. Four families, Nicatoridae, Panuridae, Alaudidae, and Macrosphenidae constitute basal splits within Sylvioidea. The division of the former sylviid/timaliid clade in five families, Sylviidae, Leiothrichidae, Pellorneidae, Timaliidae, and Zosteropidae was supported. Scotocerca, Erythrocercus, and Hylia, previously supposed to be members of Cettiidae, were shown not to belong to this family. As the three genera are also morphologically and ..."
