                "Decision making in everyday purchase situations requires mental processing of factors that are related to the items on display. These influencing factors - called persuasive information - can take various forms, like the price level, the design of the package or the display of certain product attributes. Despite the existence of persuasive information trying to influence our buying behavior, almost nothing is known about the underlying neural mechanisms responsible for processing this information. In this thesis functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate neural activity correlated with product related persuasive information. As persuasive information organic, light and regular labeled food was chosen. The 1st experiment investigated the neural correlates of visually inspected organic and regular labeled food and the influence on willingness to pay (WTP) for the displayed items. It was hypothesized that organic compared to regular labeled food will be perceived as more rewarding which should be visible by an increased activity in the ventral striatum as a central area for reward processing and by a heightened WTP. As organic label information the national German eco emblem &apos;Bio-Siegel&apos; was chosen (for stimuli details see 2.1). As there is no emblem indicating regular food, an artificially created logo was used for indicating a conventional product. 40 well- known food ...",
