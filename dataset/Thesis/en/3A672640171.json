                "Lung cancer is with approximately 40,000 deaths per year the most common cause of cancer related deaths in Germany. It is therefore necessary to develop new treatment regimes. Inhalative magnetic drug targeting may be used to treat lung cancer more effectively. For this purpose, superparamagnetic aerosol droplets are used as drug carriers. They can be carried to the target site within the lung by inhalation with assistance of magnetic gradient fields. Part of this work was to investigate whether it is possible to deflect superparamagnetic aerosols from their flight path in order to deposit them at a defined area using magnetic gradient fields. Here, parameters such as the core size of the magnetic nanoparticles, the droplet diameter, the gradient field, the ferrofluid concentration and air flow velocity were varied to investigate their influence on the deposition. The base of the magnetizable aerosol was a ferrofluid containing magnetite citrate nanoparticles dispersed in water. These particles were precipitated by adding ammonia to a solution of ferrous and ferric chloride and coated with citric acid in order to protect them against agglomeration and sedimentation. After atomization with two nebulizers based on different atomization principles, the magnetic nanoparticles are enclosed in the aerosol droplets. The mass median diameter of the aerosol droplets measured by laser diffraction was approximately 2.5 microns with the Pari Boy and 5 microns with the eFlow ..."
