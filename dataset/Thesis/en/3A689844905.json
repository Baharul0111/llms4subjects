                "Phosphines are highly versatile ligands for transition metal catalysts because of wide tuning abilites of their stereoelectronic properties. Bulky and basic -acidic phosphites were intensively phosphines, to a smaller extend also  studied whereas dicoordinated trivalent phosphorus compounds were comparatively little investigated in this respect. In part this may go back to the limited stability of many P=C compounds, in the case of the stable benzazaphosphole to low stabilityof complexes with non-zero-valent transition metals. With the availability of suitable chelate complexes this problems may be overcome. Because biaryl phosphines proved particularly useful as chelate ligands this work is focused on the development of convenient syntheses of new biaryl-type N-heterocyclic or functionally aryl substituted 1,3-benzazaphosphole P,N- P,P- and P,O-chelate ligands and the characterization of their structures. The pivotal point was to find an applicable synthetic route to the title ligands. Because currently transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are a hot field in catalytic research, the initial target of my work was the investigation of the applicability of suitable biaryl coupling reactions on 1,3-benzazaphospholes. There are several types of transition metal catalyzed biaryl couplings. One reaction, which is currently in the main focus by use of non-toxic and air stable coupling partners, often allowing water as environmental friendly solvent ..."
