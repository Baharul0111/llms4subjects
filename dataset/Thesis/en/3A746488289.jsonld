            "abstract": [
                "Chaetognaths are a fascinating taxon with unique features and a great impact on marine food webs as primary predators of zooplankton. Their phylogenetic position has been subject to many speculations ever since their discovery and even contemporary phylogenomic methods have not yet been able to suggest a stable hypothesis on their phylogenetic position within the Bilateria. Neuroanatomical studies may contribute new aspects to this discussion. This study aims to provide new insights into the chaetognath nervous system using a fresh set of methods to determine characters for a phylogenetic discussion. The method of choice in this case was immunohistochemistry combined with confocal microscopy. Experiments were conducted with a host of antibodies. The most effective target antigenes were RFamides (a family of neuropeptides), synapsins (synaptic proteins), tyrosinated tubulin (a cytoskeletal element, especially in neurites) and BrdU (bromodeoxyuridin, a proliferation marker). Each of those markers was of great use in highlighting certain aspects of the nervous system. A fresh look at the development of juvenile chaetognaths shortly after hatching revealed that the ventral nerve center (VNC) is developing earlier than the brain and that the production of neurotransmitters has already started at hatching. Specifically, some neurons exhibit RFmide-like immunoreactivity (ir). Neurogenesis continues for about five days after hatching and the mode of division in the neuronal ...",
