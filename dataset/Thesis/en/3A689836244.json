                "Northern peatlands are ecosystems with unique hydrological properties, storing about 400-500 Gt of carbon. As the production rate of organic material is higher than its decomposition, which is slowed down in the wet and cold environment, peatlands store a great amount of carbon. Carbon assimilated from the atmosphere during photosynthesis by plants is partly lost due to autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration as carbon dioxide (CO2), as methane (CH4) or/and as dissolved organic carbon. The proportion of each carbon component is strongly controlled by environmental conditions as temperature, radiation, precipitation and subsequent water table changes and active role of vegetation. With predicted changes in the global climate, changes in the influence of environmental parameters on peatland ecology are expected. Thus thorough research is essential for a better understanding of mechanisms which influence carbon cycling in peatlands. In this thesis, various components of the carbon cycle were studied at two boreal peatland sites (Ust Pojeg in Komi Republic in Russian Federation and Salmisuo in Eastern Finland) using the micrometeorological eddy covariance method. The focus was placed on the temporal changes of the controlling parameters, ranging from a few days during short snow thawing through the rest of the year. At the Salmisuo site, two measurement seasons allowed to address possible inter-annual variation. We observed that diurnal variations in methane emissions which ...",
