                "In the context of the thesis the possibility of an enzymatic N-acylation of amino acids via a thermodynamically controlled reaction in the aqueous medium was examined. A selection of biocatalysts was tested for their suitability and the aminoacylase 1 from pig kidney (pAcy1) was selected as wild-type enzyme. It could be shown that the primary problem in the pAcy1-catalyzed synthesis of the model component N-lauroyl-L-glutamate (NLLG) is a very unfavorable thermodynamic equilibrium. The equilibrium could be shifted to synthesis by adjustment of water activity and pH, however, also under optimized conditions only insufficient conversions could be obtained. As the primary problems concerning the biocatalyst a low ratio between the synthesis and hydrolysis of the product (S/H-ratio) apart from a bad acceptance of long chain acyl donors was identified. In order to arrange for protein design, a recombinant expression system was realized using a synthetic pACY1 gene integrated in the pET52(b) vector system ...",
