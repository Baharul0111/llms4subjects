                "This thesis describes experiments with clusters stored in an electrostatic ion trap called Multi-reflection time-of-flight (MR-ToF) analyzer. These devices are established as mass separators and analyzers with high resolving powers and fast processing times. The objective was to characterize an experiment that utilizes such analyzer for cluster research, to this end a laser-ablation ion source was combined with an MR-ToF analyzer. In the first part, an experiment scheme that combines two operating modes, namely in-trap lift operation and mirror operation, is presented and characterized for the present setup. For ion capture in-trap lift switching was employed and exit-side mirror switching for ejection with higher information content. Measurements were performed with small lead clusters to illustrate individual advantages of both techniques and the gain of combining them with focus on the ions’ ToF ejection window. In the second part, a recently introduced method of ion separation by transversal ejection of unwanted species inside the trap was studied for the present setup. The ejection is performed by appropriate pulses of the potentials of deflector electrodes located in the trap. The various parameters affecting the selection effectivity and resolving power are illustrated with tin-cluster measurements, with resolving powers of up to several tens of thousands. The third part presents the experiment in detail, with the construction of each component and measurements for its ...",
