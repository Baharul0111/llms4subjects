                "In many industrial sectors biotechnological production processes have replaced pure chemical methods and allowed new, ecologically friendly and enzyme-based processes. Microorganisms, such as modified Bacillus strains are used in particular for the industrial enzyme synthesis. The two organisms Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus pumilus are of great industrial importance. B. licheniformis is able to secrete proteins in large amounts, while B. pumilus shows high resistance to oxidative stress. During production processes different conditions can occur that affect the physiology of the production hosts and may result in a quantitative, but also a qualitative impairment of the products. This influence is based on e.g. chemical processes, the setting of temperature, pH, or oxygen availability and can lead to various stress situations for the bacteria. Cells respond to changes in their environment by sensing stressors and initiate a response to the stress, which is usually implemented by an induction or derepression of various regulons. In order to conduct an optimal production process, the metabolism and stress responses of the utilized bacteria should be known exactly. The aim of this study was to analyze of the stress response of B. licheniformis to heat and salt stress, and the stress response of B. licheniformis and B. pumilus to oxidative stress. These analyses were performed at the level of transcriptomics using cDNA microarrays, which is the most direct and global method ...",
