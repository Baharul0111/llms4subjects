                "In magnetized plasmas the understanding of the plasma dynamics in response to magnetic fluctuations is of particular interest. These fluctuations appear in form of linear and nonlinear wave phenomena and also as a change of the magnetic field topology. In the context of the present thesis the influence of low-frequency electromagnetic waves and topological changes of magnetic fields caused by magnetic reconnection on the ion dynamics was experimentally investigated. In the linear magnetized laboratory experiment VINETA kinetic Alfvén waves were excited and identified via detailed measurements of the waves dispersion by means of magnetic fluctuation diagnostics. For the understanding of the dispersion behavior boundary effects and the influence of collisions must be taken into account. The ion velocity distribution function (IVDF) was measured with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). The standard LIF scheme was extended to obtain phase-resolved IVDFs in case of periodic perturbations. The electrical fields of the linear Alfvén waves, which are driven by small amplitude magnetic perturbations, are however usually too small, to significantly influence the ion dynamics ...",
