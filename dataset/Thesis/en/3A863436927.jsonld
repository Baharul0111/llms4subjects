                "In this work, three new imine reductases (IRED) were identified and biochemically characterized. One of these enzymes, whose crystal structure was solved, however, no functionality was describes. While examining the substrate spectrum it was shown for the first time that, in addition to cyclic imines and amines, acyclic amines can be substrates of the IRED. Moreover, it could be shown, that ketones or aldehydes can be reductively aminated with ammonia or primary amines applying IREDs. The crystallization of these IREDs and 15 other new IREDs were investigated. For three enzymes good crystals could be obtained and it was demonstrated for the first time that IREDs crystals can be obtained of if NADP + was co-crystallized. Two of these enzymes carry unusual residues in the active site (glutamate and asparagine). So far, mostly aspartate for (R) -selective or tyrosine for (S) -selective IREDs are described. An exception is the in this work characterized IRED Ppu which carries a histidine one turn upstream (in the sequence in the direction of the C-terminus) of the IRED and forms a third group of IRED in phylogenetic tree. In addition immobilization of IREDs was reported the first time. We were able to design a variant of the IRED Sgf3587 showing a 3-fold increase in acceptance of NADH. Since all IRED described previously prefer NADPH strongly, the K40A variant of Sgf3587 IRED is an alternative, which can use the less expensive cofactor NADH. Another examined method to reduce ...",
