                "Forests are and have been of major importance to cover a variety of societal needs. Today the demands on forests are ever increasing with sequestering carbon and balancing the climate, to name only a few. To cover those requirements forests need vital, productive, and sustainable. A difficult concept as such as the understanding of a healthy forest varies greatly. Nevertheless, forests still have to produce a sufficient amount of yield while threatened by changing climate conditions. These are predicted to bring extended and more intense drought periods as well as a higher frequency of storms and the promotion of secondary disturbances like insects calamities to also rise. In this complex situation of high and versatile demand the focus is on the allocation of the “right” forest. Forest management is requested to balance the needs of humans against those of wildlife against those of the trees themselves. To gain the respective knowledge on species responses and provenance growth, now and in the future research gaps need to be closed. All factors influencing tree growth and therefore ultimately yield need to be understood and special focus needs to be on the interactions within the forest ecosystem. One of the parameters in understanding aggregated tree growth is the dynamic of growth. This can be visualised by dendroecological methods, providing a picture of growth within the individual years. Growth dynamics are dependent on multiple factors, some, like soil being ..."
