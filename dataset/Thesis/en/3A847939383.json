                "This work examines the structural properties of SCO3201, a member of the TetR-like family of regulators, whose 3D structure was unknown until now and which shows low sequential identity to other members of its family. SCO3201 has been identified to be a repressor protein which, when overexpressed, supresses antibiotics production as well as the morphological differentiation process. In earlier work it has been shown that this regulator can bind to at least 16 different promotor regions. The protein was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli and subsequently purified. Due to the absence of a suitable homology model, the solution of the structure was unobtainable at first, in spite of a successful crystallisation of the protein. However, a successful Single Anomalous Dispersion experiment enabled the acquisition of phases and delivered the structure of the partly induced repressor. Furthermore, the structure of the apo-form of SCO3201 was acquired as well. This allowed the localisation of the ligand binding site as well as tracking the domain movement of the induction process. Also, a Small Angle X-Ray Scattering experiment was conducted to investigate the structure of SCO3201 in solution, which allowed checking for crystallisation artefacts. Subsequently, the Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay was employed to analyse the regulator-operator-interactions of SCO3201 with its operator.",
