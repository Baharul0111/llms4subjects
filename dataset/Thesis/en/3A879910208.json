                "Different studies provide repeatedly, that there is a positive influence of endurance exercise on several cognitive and mental functions by elderly people and invalids. This experimental study should examine if likewise young and healthy people benefit from a standardised and still individually endurance exercise program by the view on particular aspects of their cognitive performance. Using a cross-over-study (wait-control-design), the effect of an eight-week endurance running program (3x/week, 40-60 min) on particular issues of the executive functions by young healthy people was examined. 37 probands were randomized separated in two groups. The intervention group passed an eight-week endurance program, whereas the control group performed a normal routine activity. After these eight weeks the groups changed their activity mode, so that now the initial control group started with the eight week endurance program and the former intervention group stopped their additional physical activity. In both groups the executive performance was determined three times (starting point of the study, after the first eight weeks and after overall 16 weeks). However, there was no significant improvement of the executive functions in the course of the intervention program. In a second view, by using the heart-rate-variability as a constituent of the autonomic nervous system, there was no statistical influence of endurance exercise on executive function as well. Rather there must be expressed ..."
