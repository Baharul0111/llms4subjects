                "In this thesis, two novel assay systems had been developed, which allow a fast and easy screening for amine transaminase activity as well as the characterization of the amino donor and acceptor specificity of a given amine transaminase. The assays overcome some limitations of previously described assays but of course have some limitations themselves. The relatively low wavelength of 245 nm, at which the production of acetophenone is detected with the spectrophotometric assay, limits the amount of protein/crude extract that can be applied, which eventually results in a decreased sensitivity at higher enzyme loads due to an increased initial absorbance. Otherwise, this assay can be used very easily for the investigation of the amino acceptor specificity and both pH and temperature dependencies of amine transaminases. The conductometric assay is - by its very nature - limited to low-conducting buffers, a neutral pH and constant temperatures. In summary, the assays complement one another very well and the complete characterization of the most important enzyme properties can be accomplished quickly. Furthermore, we developed and applied a novel in silico search strategy for the identification of (R)-selective amine transaminases in sequence databases. Structural information of probably related proteins was used for rational protein design to predict key amino acid substitutions that indicate the desired activity. We subsequently searched protein ...",
