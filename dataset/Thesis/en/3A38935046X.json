                "The process of urbanisation between 1830 and 1918 was unfolding under the influence of the industrial revolution with a special dynamism in the development of Berlin from a royal residence city to an economic metropolis. Wedged between the claims to shaping the City on the one hand of the bureaucracy and the crown, and the industrial bourgeoisie on the other, the architecture of the early industrial buildings is evolving. Under these circumstances, standards were set for the construction of factories, which subsequently were acknowledged by both the industrial clients and the municipal master builders. From 1858, James Hobrecht is developing a comprehensive concept for the extension of the City, which remains valid far into 20th century. Starting with 1860, blocks of rented flats and municipal facilities were erected with industrial methods for a city millions. Hobrecht&apos;s life work as the most influential urban planner of Berlin is exemplary for the outstanding role, which in this period is incumbent on the civil engineers even more than on the architects. However, this principle is reaching its limits after 1890. The large industrial corporations open up a new phase of urban expansion at Berlin&apos;s periphery. The example of the industrial town of Oberschoneweide shows the very substantial impact on communal planning. Here, an important chapter in the history of industry architecture is being written, a chapter embracing between 1995 and 1918 all essential qualitative and stylistic developments, which are associated with the beginning of the modern architectural age."
