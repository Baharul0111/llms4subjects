                "Biological processes are highly complex and are realized in large parts by proteins, which make up the morphological structure as well as diversity and specificity of different cell types. Proteins do not act in an isolated manner but by interacting with each other or other molecules in the cell (DNA, metabolites, signal molecules etc.). Disturbance of this interplay can cause diseases. Knowing which interactions are deregulated can help to better understand and intervene against the diseases. In this doctoral thesis, a method is developed to identify such differentially regulated interactions. This method has been implemented as a software named ExprEssence. It identifies such interactions from a protein protein interaction network that are changing most strongly between two compared conditions (e.g. diseased versus control). The aim is to condense the network such that it contains only the essential differences between both compared states. For this, transcriptome or proteome data are mapped onto the network and the level of interaction strength is estimated for each protein interaction. Interactions that are changing most strongly are kept, the other interactions are removed. The remaining interactions and their proteins are candidates for explanation of biological differences on a molecular level. The method has been applied to several biological questions and the results have been compared with other methods. Investigating differences between success and non-success ...",
