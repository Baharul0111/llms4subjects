                "The general stress response comprises approximately 200 genes and is driven by the alternative sigma factor SigB. Besides the process of sporulation with approximately 500 involved gene products under initial control of Spo0A are the two most significant and extensive cellular responses that can be observed in B. subtilis. The general stress response provides vegetative growing as well as non-growing and non-sporulating cells with a comprehensive cross-protective and preventive multiple stress resistance to various hostile environmental conditions. In contrast, the endospore is the most resistant but also dormant cell type produced by B. subtilis. The scope of this study was the identification of regulatory cascades driven by the general stress response sigma factor SigB to further elucidate the structure and function of the general stress regulon itself and to uncover potential intersections between the SigB response and other major developmental programs in the regulatory network of B. subtilis. It could be shown that the general stress regulon member yqgZ encodes a functional paralogue of Spx, the global regulator of the diamide stress regulon in B. subtilis. Global transcriptome and proteome studies led to the characterization of an YqgZ sub-regulon consisting of 53 positively and 18 negatively regulated genes. Due to its stringent SigB-dependent expression as well as its concerted action with SigB in regulation of its target genes YqgZ was renamed to MgsR which stands ..."
