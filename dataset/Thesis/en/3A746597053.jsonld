                "Aim: The aim of the present research was to determine the contribution of local industrial companies against right-wing extremism within their workforce and analyze which measures they could implement for preventing and reducing right-wing extremism. It was assumed, that companies could reduce right-wing extremism by providing a work environment that minimizes job insecurity and ensures commitment and job satisfaction. Furthermore, a positive organizational culture should aid employees in resisting right-wing orientations. Method: Eight industrial companies from four different branches participated in this study. All were located in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, and had more than 100 employees. In total, data from 485 employees was accepted for final analyses. There were 141 women, aged between 24 and 59 years (M = 46.16, SD = 8.65), and 344 men, aged between 20 and 64 years (M = 45.91, SD = 9.08). Results: Perceived low job insecurity and high affective commitment protect against right-wing orientations, while low job satisfaction does not. Additionally, perceived job insecurity is dependent on affective commitment. In turn, a positive organizational culture leads to higher affective commitment. Furthermore, these relations are mediated by personal dispositions: Individuals with high authoritarianism and a low social dominance orientation react stronger to perceived job insecurity, while individuals with low authoritarianism and a high social dominance orientation ...",
