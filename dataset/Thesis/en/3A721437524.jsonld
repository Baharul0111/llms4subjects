                "Beams of ions and electrons are a source of free energy which can be transferred to waves via an instability. Beams exist in almost all plasma environments, but their instabilities are particularly important for the dynamics of space plasmas. In the absence of collisions, the instability drives waves to large amplitudes and forms nonlinear structures such as solitary waves. The electric fields in these waves can scatter particles in the background plasma, or disrupt currents. Both of these effects are important for the overall dynamics of the plasma. In this thesis, both electron and ion beam plasma instabilities have been investigated in the linear plasma device VINETA and using a Particle-in-Cell simulation. The electron beam instability has been demonstrated by previous authors to be a useful diagnostic for the plasma density. The spatial resolution of previous results was confirmed at a few millimetres, and a temporal resolution of 1ms was shown for the first time. An ion beam was generated with a double plasma discharge. Compared to space, this environment and indeed most laboratory plasmas have considerably higher collisionality and a limited spatial extent which introduces gradients in the plasma. Gradients perpendicular to the beam propagation direction are linked to a decrease of both the wavelength and amplitude of the instability. It was observed in both experiment and simulation that gradients in sheaths at the boundaries of the plasma not only affect ..."
