            "abstract": [
                "Bats are ancient mammals that evolved more than 50 million years ago. There are 1,240 different species (&gt; 20% of mammalian species) described so far, which represent one of the most abundant, diverse and widely distributed mammalian groups. Bats are the only mammals which actively fly and therefore can migrate to different areas of the world. It has been increasingly recognized that bats are reservoirs for more than 100 virus species, and several are associated with animal and human epidemics. As natural hosts of rabies virus (RABV) and related lyssaviruses, bats have become a focus of research not only in South America and Africa, but also in Europe and North America. Bats are also considered to be unique in their potential to host emerging and re-emerging zoonotic viruses. To evaluate and reduce the potential risk of rabies transmission to humans or carnivore hosts (like fox, raccoon and dog etc.), active and passive surveillance studies of bat have been performed. Using these approaches diverse lyssaviruses have been detected in bats. However, these studies did not explain the rarely discovered epidemics and the underlying resistance or immune mechanisms in bats as natural hosts for lyssaviruses. Probably, bats are more resistant to lyssavirus infections than other animals. This hypothesis is introducing the research questions of the present thesis: (1) How do the innate immune responses protect bats from fatal outcome of lyssavirus infections?
