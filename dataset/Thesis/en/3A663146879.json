                "Wild birds are the natural hosts and main reservoir for influenza A viruses of all known subtypes. However, some influenza viruses have established stable lineages in mammals. The molecular basis of host restriction and adaptation of influenza viruses is determined by the interaction of viral proteins with specific host cell factors and based on adaptive point mutations in the viral polymerase proteins enhancing viral replication in a species-specific manner. To identify host-specific interaction partners of viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes, recombinant influenza A viruses with a Strep affinity tag at the C-terminus of the polymerase protein PB2 were generated by reverse genetics. For this, a human H3N2 strain, an avian H3N8 strain and two strains of subtype H5N1 and H7N7 infecting avian and mammalian hosts were used. The stable expression of Strep-tagged fusion protein in infected cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Replication of tagged mutants was shown to be comparable to that of the untagged recombinant parent viruses. Tagged vRNP complexes were purified from human and avian cell extracts by affinity chromatography. All vRNP protein components were successfully identified by MALDI-tof mass spectrometry. These experiments form the basis for ongoing studies to investigate virus-host-specific interactions that are important for host switch and adaptation of influenza A viruses. The pandemic virus A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2) (Hk68) is a reassortant between the at that time circulating human H2N2 and an avian H3 strain which provided its HA and PB1 segments ..."
