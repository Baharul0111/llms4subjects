                "The focus of the first two articles was the engineering and application of enzymes for the conversion of the bio-based resources glycerol and its oxidation product glyceraldehyde for the production of the value added product glyceric acid. Article III focuses on the cloning, exploration and engineering of a polyol dehydrogenase, which later on was used as cofactor recycling system in order to produce ?-caprolactone from cyclohexanol as presented in arti-cle IV. The following paragraphs will give a short outline of each article. ARTICLE I: ASYMMETRIC SYNTHESIS OF D-GLYCERIC ACID BY AN ALDITOL OXIDASE AND DIRECTED EVOLUTION FOR ENHANCED OXIDATIVE ACTIVITY TOWARDS GLYCEROL. GERSTENBRUCH, S., WULF, H., MUÃŸMANN, N., O&apos;CONNELL, T., MAURER, K.-H. &amp; BORNSCHEUER, U. T. (2012). Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 96, 1243-1252. The alditol oxidase of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) (AldO) was used to catalyze the oxida-tion of glycerol to glyceraldehyde and glyceric acid. The enantioselectivity for the FAD-de-pendent glycerol oxidation was elucidated and different strategies were used to enhance the substrate specificity towards glycerol. Directed evolution by error-prone PCR led to an AldO double mutant with 1.5-fold improved activity for glycerol. Further improvement of activity was achieved by combination of mutations, leading to a quadruple mutant with 2.4-fold higher specific activity towards glycerol compared to the wild-type enzyme. In small-scale biotransformation concentrations ...",
