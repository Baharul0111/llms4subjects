                "High-throughput expression data have become the norm in molecular biology research. However, the analysis of expression data is statistically and computationally challenging and has not kept up with their generation. This has resulted in large amounts of unexplored data in public repositories. After pre-processing and quality control, the typical gene expression analysis workflow follows two main steps. First, the complexity of the data is reduced by removing the genes that are redundant or irrelevant for the biological question that motivated the experiment, using a feature selection method. Second, relevant genes are investigated to extract biological information that could aid in the interpretation of the results. Different methods, such as functional annotation, clustering, network analysis, and/or combinations thereof are useful for the latter purpose. Here, I investigated and presented solutions to three problems encountered in the expression data analysis workflow. First, I worked on reducing complexity of high-throughput expression data by selecting relevant genes in the context of the sample classification problem. The sample classification problem aims to assign unknown samples into one of the known classes, such as healthy and diseased. For this purpose, I developed the relative signal-to-noise ratio (rSNR), a novel feature selection method which was shown to perform significantly better than other methods with similar objectives. Second, to better understand ..."
