                "Modern man is native all over the world as barely any other species. Hence, the human being had to adapt to various geographical conditions. Morphological changes related to the skull were the consequence. However, there are several varying points of view about the relevance of geographical aspects for certain skull components, especially related to the size and shape of the nasal cavity. Since the clarification of those relations is meaningful for various subjects such as anatomy, physiology, forensic medicine and anthropology, the study analyses the relation between the morphology of the nasal cavity and the midface considering climatic aspects. The analyses of the nasal cavities were accomplished with the aid of 62 macerated adult skulls of four different human populations varying in regard to their geographic origin. At first, each skull was CT-scanned. Afterwards, the linear lengths of the nasal cavities were investigated through the CT-scan. Moreover, the volume of the nasal cavity was identified with the aid of the WinSurf software program. Additionally, the measurements of the outer skull with linear measures took place in order to analyze the relations between the nasal cavity and the visceral cranium. The external metrics of the skull were required for the calculation of the craniofacial volume. The findings of the thesis show that there are population-specific differences concerning the absolute and relative size of the nasal cavity volume ..."
