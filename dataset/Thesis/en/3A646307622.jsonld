                "After its introduction in federal state Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (MV) in 2004 the \"child&apos;s dental booklet\" offers an opportunity for a complete documentation of children&apos;s dental career and thus to improve the preventive oral health care among the preschool children In a cross-sectional study in February 2009, all dentists in MV were interviewed using a questionnaire on this issue. A share of 17.86% of all the interviewed dental practices participated in this study. All in all the analysis was based on data with high predictive quality, because it included almost all specialists in pediatric dentistry The high representativeness of the survey results for Mecklenburg-Vorpommern allowed the development of goal-oriented solution proposals in this PhD. The study revealed an overall positive response from the concerned patients. The parents who have an overall good entrainment behavior (57.7% bring the booklet to more than 75% of doctor visits) attach a high importance to the child&apos;s dental booklet (86.5% believe it is important or helpful). These values are important for preventive care. 72.1% of the dentists states that the cooperation of the small patients has improved through the use of children&apos;s dental booklet and 61.4% see a perceptible progress in oral health. As well the consultation behavior of the patients was improved (57.2%). 81.4% of the dentists involve the health booklet for each infant treatment or at least often, 90.3% taking advantage of the provided findings documentation. 92.2% of dentists assess the child&apos;s dental booklet as a useful method for preventive care ...",
