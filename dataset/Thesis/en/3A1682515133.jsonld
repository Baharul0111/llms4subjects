                "We all know the experience of different demands on ourselves. As a parent, we want to be there for our children, and in pursuit of our career, we want to invest as much time as possible. If we are committed to both being a good parent and pursuing a career, it may be impossible to satisfy the demands stemming from both commitments. It is in such moments in which our, what I call, practical identities are conflicted that our will is in a state of volitional disunity. In this dissertation, I discuss how a person may best cope with volitional disunity. I define practical identities in line with Christine M. Korsgaard as self-descriptions under which a person finds her life worth living and her actions worth undertaking; examples of such self-descriptions are being a parent, an employee, a hobbyist pianist, the friend of Charlotte, etc. Practical identities provide the person with ideals that form a decision-making framework for her deliberations about what to do. The standard analysis of volitional disunity, is that it causes a person to not know what to do as her identities, as guides, point her in conflicting, even opposite, directions. The solutions proposed in the literature always include, what I call, the Unification Ideal: a person has to prioritize her identities by deciding which is more important to her. By unifying her identities in this way, she constitutes who she is and wants to be thereby providing herself with a clear decision-making framework regarding the ..."
