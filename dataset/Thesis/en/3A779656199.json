                "The main objective of this study was to answer the question of whether long-term jailed sex offenders experience everyday prisonlife more stressful than violent offenders do. Here, a main focus was on the possible existence of a supposed hierarchical structure within a detention center, under the assumption that sex offenders have a lower social status in this regard compared to violent offenders. The characteristics of trauma ,experience of violence, detention atmosphere, sense of security, cases of assaults and suicides, as well as social contacts were extracted for examination. From the population of N = 1055 European long-term convicts n = 670 violent offenders and n = 147 sex offenders were determined. As a main result of this study, it was shown that european long-term inmates with either sexual or violent delinquency represent a highly traumatised and highly stressed population. In concrete terms, a ratio which stood at nine out of ten sufferers was revealed. Furthermore, it was shown that the nature of the (early) childhood trauma has a significant impact on the convicted offense later in life. It was found that sex offender victims experienced sexually motivated attacks significantly more often, whereas violent offenders had become significantly more frequently victims of physical violence. No significant differences between the groups were found for the characteristic such as number of suicides, threat experiences or hierarchical position. Partial confirmation ..."
