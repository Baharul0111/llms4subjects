            "abstract": [
                "In this thesis several methods of protein engineering were applied to explore and increase enantioselectivity and thermostability of certain carboxylesterases and to better understand the relationship between sequence, structure and function. For example, we were able to confirm the observed conservation of motifs like GX/GGGX and GXSXG, which was reported earlier. Yet, even more details were revealed and some were designated in numbers. However, the numbers may vary when even more sequences will be available, but the trend should remain the same. The power of the ABHDB lies in the information available throughout the very diverse and quite large superfamily. Structural equal positions can be easily compared and analysed regarding mutations, correlated mutations, prevalence etc., and visualization is simplified through direct output with YASARA software. The ABHDB was the first structural alignment of such a large number of known enzymes of the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold superfamily. With methods of rational protein engineering we were able to show that there is little flexibility of the GGG(A)X motif for the eukaryotic enzyme PLE 1 and the natural motif appears to be a good solution for high activity and enantioselectivity of PLE 1 in the conversion of tertiary alcohol esters. In a focused directed evolution approach, we were able to identify variants of BsteE with moderate, but significantly increased enantioselectivity in the kinetic resolution of tetrahydrofuran-3-yl ...",
