                "Forest ecosystems around the world and especially boreal forests, are facing drastically changing climatic conditions. It is known that these changes could challenge their functionality and vitality. Still, the exact impact is not fully understood, as tree growth is a complex process and depends on countless environmental and genetic factors. To estimate the effects of climate change on tree growth and forest development precisely, we must learn more about tree growth itself. A comprehensive approach is needed where trees and forests are investigated on different scales and levels of detail, ranging from global studies to studies on single individuals. In this dissertation, I follow such a comprehensive approach, using the North American conifer white spruce as an example. I present three papers in the form of three chapters in which my co-authors and I studied the growth and anatomy of white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) and how it is influenced by environmental, climatic, and genetic factors. We used diverse approaches and methods on different spatial scales, ranging from investigations on the landscape to the local scale. We established three paired plots with forest and treeline sites (two cold-limited and one drought-limited). as well as one additional forest site. In the first chapter, we concentrated on the genetic diversity of white spruce within and between populations at all study sites throughout Alaska. The genetic investigations were combined with analyses ...",
