                "Solifuges (Solifugae, Arachnida) are an important element of the fauna especially in arid and desert environments. Unfortunately, this animal group has only been extremely poorly studied not only in terms of morphology, but also ecology, physiology, systematics and phylogeny. The present study aimed to provide a detailed overview of their anatomy and ultrastructure. Representatives of these peculiar animals were investigated by means of light and electron microscopy in order to gain new insights in their functional morphology and also to evaluate potential characters for their systematic and future phylogenetic studies. The histology and ultrastructure of the following organ systems have been investigated: tarsal structures, sensory structures and nervous system, coxal glands, alimentary system, respiratory system, circulatory system and reproductive systems. Additionally, a camel spider in Baltic amber was described, representing the second known specimen of fossil Solifugae in Baltic amber. Further on, the entire mitochondrial genome of Nothopuga sp. was sequenced for comparison with other solifuges and chelicerates in order to reveal changes in their gene order."
