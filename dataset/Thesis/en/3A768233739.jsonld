                "Genomics is the field of modern biology that studies the genome as the sum of all genes of a given organism. Genomics includes the analysis of genomic variations in order to identify genetic susceptibility loci for various human diseases. Besides genomics, there are related fields summarized by the term \"Omics\" such as transcriptomics and proteomics, studying the sum of all transcripts and proteins in a defined biological system, respectively. Genetic variants, namely single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs) are used to identify genomic loci associated with human traits and diseases. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) based on SNP data have been performed for a wide range of human traits and diseases. In the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) and the independent SHIP-TREND study, whole-genome genotyping data were available for 4081 and 986 individuals, respectively. In contrast to the widely used GWAS based on SNPs, association studies using CNV data are difficult to implement and thus less common. Therefore, one aim of this work was to detect CNVs using the whole-genome genotyping data available for 4081 individuals from SHIP. Another aim was to develop an efficient workflow for the analysis of these CNVs. As most common genetic variants exhibit only relatively small effects on phenotypic variability, large sample sizes are needed to maximize the statistical power to detect such effects. Therefore, the integration of ...",
