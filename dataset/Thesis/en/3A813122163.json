                "This thesis describes the synthesis of modified nucleosides. Four nucleoside analogs were prepared, whose fields of application are of entirely different nature. They represent important tools for expanding the properties of nucleic acids, as well as the characterization of oligonucleotides. Within the scope of this work, the stage was set for the selection of a cytidine deaminase ribozyme. An assay for the in-vitro selection was presented, as well as the design and the 16-step synthesis of the required key molecule, a cytidine derivative. Two linker moieties of different lengths and functionality were attached to the nucleobase and to the ribose of cytidine, in order to facilitate coupling of the nucleoside to periodate-oxidized RNAs, and for linking the functionalized library to a surface. A 5&apos;-O-coupled hexaethylene glycol linker carrying an aliphatic amino group allows 3&apos;-terminal conjugation of cytidine to the molecules of an RNA library, whereas a biotinylated linker attached to C4 of cytosine allows linking of the modified library to a streptavindine coated surface. The suitability of the synthesized cytidine derivative for functionalization of RNAs was confirmed by successful conjugation to the 3&apos;-terminus of a model RNA, as analyzed by HPLC and MALDI-MS. This set-up is going to be used for selection of a cytidine deaminase ribozyme supporting the conversion of uridine to cytidine. Furthermore, within the framework of two cooperative projects, three additional ...",
