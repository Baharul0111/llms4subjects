            "abstract": "\"In this concise and accessible new biography, Martyn Bennett examines the life of Oliver Cromwell - one of the most controversial figures in world history. Elected to parliament in 1640 Cromwell played a major role in challenging the excessive powers of Charles I. As Lieutenant General, his military campaigns were crucial to victory during the Civil War and he was instrumental in the trial and execution of the king. As Lord Protector of the Commonwealth he remains the only non-royal head of state in British history. His rule was characterised by unprecedented religious freedoms and is seen as laying the foundations for the modern British constitution. However, Cromwell&apos;s legacy in Ireland and Scotland has greatly troubled his reputation. Furthermore, Cromwell&apos;s government is often viewed as an anomaly - a temporary hiatus before the re-establishment of the monarchy.\" \"Martyn Bennett challenges these long-held perceptions of Cromwell and the Commonwealth, arguing that in his role as &apos;God&apos;s Constable&apos;, he needs to be placed at the core of early Modern British and Irish history, Charting his early career, the origins of his political and religious thought and the development of his notions of governance that influenced him as Lord Protector, Martyn Bennett contests the post-Restoration vilification of Cromwell to examine how his influence has shaped notions of citizenship, identity and governance and informed the relationship between religion and the state in Britain.\"--Jacket",
