# About

The `llms4subjects` repository hosts a dataset designed for a task that involves using large language models (LLMs) for automated subject tagging within the [TIB](https://www.tib.eu/)'s (German National Library of Science and Technology) open access catalogue of technical records, known as TIBKAT, restricted to only those with abstracts metadata. This collection can be browsed on the TIB portal [here](https://www.tib.eu/en/search?tx_tibsearch_search%5Baction%5D=search&tx_tibsearch_search%5Bcnt%5D=20&tx_tibsearch_search%5Bcontroller%5D=Search&tx_tibsearch_search%5BgroupField%5D=matchTitleTypeFirstAuthor_str&tx_tibsearch_search%5Bpg%5D=1&tx_tibsearch_search%5Bquery%5D=prefix%3Atibkat%20%2Babstract%3A%2A%20%2BxmlPath%3Asubject%2F%40type%3Dgnd&cHash=f451c3e5094da4379c764584d10afc8d). The collection, which includes a variety of records like articles, conference proceedings, and books, is already open access but is re-released in this repository as it is specifically systematically re-organized to introduce researchers to the collection, its various formats, and to thereby facilitate researchers to more easily develop their LLM-based applications. The aim is to leverage the best system as the outcome of the proposed task for the automated subject tagging of TIB's future collections, supporting a broader vision of enhancing efficiency through technology.


# Repositories included

- The [dataset](https://github.com/jd-coderepos/llms4subjects/tree/main/dataset) repo contains that main training and test datasets released for the shared task. Majority of the TIBKAT collections are in German and English, therefore, this shared task will focus only on evaluating LLMs that can handle both German and English.
- The [supplementary-dataset](https://github.com/jd-coderepos/llms4subjects/tree/main/additional-train-dataset) repo contains those records in TIBKAT excluded from the main task dataset for the following reasons: they are in languages other than english or german; for a specific record type, the collection is too sparse. As mentioned earlier, while the aim of the task is to obtain LLM-based solutions to handle English and German, the excluded records from the TIBKAT are still made available to the participants to use as they choose.
- The [analysis](https://github.com/jd-coderepos/llms4subjects/tree/main/analysis) repo contains various statistics information files of the entire TIBKAT collection that were considered to reorganize the collection as a main and supplementary shared task dataset.
