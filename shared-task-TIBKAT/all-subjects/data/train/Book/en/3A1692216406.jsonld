            "abstract": "\"Philip K. Dick was a visionary writer of science fiction who has recently experienced a resurgence in popularity. His works speak to contemporary fears of being continually watched by technology and the paranoia of modern life in which we watch ourselves and lose our sense of identity. Since his death in 1982, Dick's writing remains something that feels frighteningly relevant to 21st century audiences. Despite this foresight, Dick spent his life in near poverty and it was only after his death that he gained popular and critical recognition. In this new collection of essays, interviews, and talks, Philip K Dick is rediscovered. Concentrating both on studies of Dick's writing from recent critical perspectives, and on reassessing his legacy in light of his new status as a \"major American author,\" these essays explore, just what happened culturally and critically to precipitate his extraordinary rise in reputation. Individual essays look for his traces in the places he lived, in the SF community he came from, and in his influence on contemporary American literature and culture, and beyond.--",
