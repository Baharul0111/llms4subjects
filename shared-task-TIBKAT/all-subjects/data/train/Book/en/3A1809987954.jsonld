I have admired Taudin's work for years, especially his illustrations of Albert Einstein and concepts from relativity that have enriched a series of books by my colleagues.\" -- Introduction by the author (Seite 8) -- \" In the main series of new illustrations, Taudin uses the graphic element of polyhedra to capture the multifaceted nature of Dyson's efforts and contributions. Dyson endeavored to think about questions from many angles, his own work reflected insights and methods from intellectual traditions that rarely aligned in straightforward ways. For the second series of illustrations, Taudin invokes musical metaphors and sensations of sound. Dyson's father was an accomplished musician, and young Dyson pursued the violin. But the idea of playing the violin made a deeper impression. He later explained to an interview that he played with mathematical tools because they were \"beautiful\", much as a violinist plays for love of the instrument.",
