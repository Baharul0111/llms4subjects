            "abstract": "\"Alan Sharp was Scotland's greatest screenwriter and one of its most important transnational writers. The adopted son of a Greenock shipyard worker, he became a bestselling novelist, a leading playwright, a record-breaking Hollywood screenwriter and the central figure of a new Scottish national film industry. Today, however, his books, television plays and screenplays are forgotten. This study seeks to restore his work to the prominence it deserves. Including previously unknown work available only now in the Alan Sharp papers collection in the University of Dundee Archive, it traces the life's work of a man who made a unique contribution to Scottish culture and considers his themes, especially his awareness of landcape and his use of the ambivalent male protagonist, the anti-hero. Working in exile but consistently 'coming back' to his homeland, Sharp worked from a point of view which allowed him to love Scottish culture without having to pamper it and gave him the detachment to connect it with others. 'The Anti-hero's Journey' seeks to reposition him as a vital component of Scottish culture from the 1960s into the twenty-first century and proposes that he shoud be re-evaluated as a major contributor to contemporary transnational Scottish cultural history\"--",
