            "title": "100 years of Danish modern : Vilhelm Lauritzen Architects",
            "abstract": "100 Years of Danish Modern' unfolds the story of the modern society from the perspective of the architecture and the work of Vilhelm Lauritzen Architects. It is a story about ideas and buildings which have stayed relevant for a century. Architecture does more than just to reflect the modern society. It has been part of shaping and building it. Vilhelm Lauritzen Architects occupies an important position in Scandinavian architecture, as the practice has evolved alongside and not at least influenced the Nordic modernist movement for the past 100 years. The history of Vilhelm Lauritzen Architects along with its many architectural masterpieces reflect the development and ideal of the welfare society. Supporting the notion that access to good housing, health care, culture and education ? architecture that had previously been reserved for the elite ? should be for everyone. This is visible in iconic modernist architecture such as Copenhagen Airport, the Radio House, and VEGA. Vilhelm Lauritzen Architects is also behind new masterpieces such as DR Byen, housing Kr\u00f8yers Plads as well as the coming New North Zealand Hospital. Christian Bundegaard is the author behind this publication and holds a master's degree in philosophy. He has previously written an internationally well-received monography on ?Finn Juhl ? Life, Work, World?",
